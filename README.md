# Source for www.bloovis.com

This repository contains the source code for my web site,
`www.bloovis.com`.  The site is built with Hugo and the Hextra theme.
If you clone a copy of the source, you will probably have to
run this command to initialize the theme, which is a git submodule:

    git submodule update --init

Note that this repository does not include the source for the
gallery portion of the web site.  At some point, I will provide
the source for the gallery, but without the image files.

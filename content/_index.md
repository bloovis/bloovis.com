Welcome to my shabby little corner of the glorious World Wide Web.
You'll probably regret having ended up here, but just in case,
here's what you'll find:

* [Posts](/posts/): my worthless blog, ignored by all since 2008
* [Pages](/pages/): some non-blog documents, including *The Annotated Lamb Lies Down on Broadway*
* [Gallery](/gallery/): my artless photographs
* [Source code repositories](/fossil/): my useless open source projects

If you dislike what you see here, and want to tell me about it,
you can find my email address in the [About](/about/) page.

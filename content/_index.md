Welcome to my shabby little corner of the glorious World Wide Web.
You'll probably regret having ended up here, but just in case,
here's what you'll find:

* [Posts](/posts/): my worthless blog, ignored by all since 2008
* [Tags](/tags): posts grouped by tags
* [Pages](/pages/): some non-blog documents, including *The Annotated Lamb Lies Down on Broadway*
* [Gallery](/gallery/): my artless photographs
* [Source code repositories](/fossil/): my useless open source projects

Information about building a [FirstDay Cottage](http://www.firstdaycottage.com/)
in Vermont in 2012-2013 is here:

* [All posts in reverse chronological order](/tags/firstday-cottage/)
* [First post](/posts/2012-05-11-firstday-cottage-under-way/)
* [Pictures](/gallery/firstday-cottage/)

There are also two sub-blogs here:

* [Verbal Abuse](/abuse/): my experience with verbal abuse in my marriage
* [Scamdemic](/scamdemic): my mostly sarcastic writings about the Great Covid Psyop

The source code for this site is here:

* [Main Site](https://github.com/bloovis/bloovis.com): the main portion of the site
* [Gallery](https://github.com/bloovis/gallery): the gallery portion of the site (minus the images)

If you dislike what you see here, and want to tell me about it,
you can find my email address in the [About](/about/) page.

As an experiment, I have enabled [Giscus](https://giscus.app) comments
on some of the pages on this site, specifically the [About](/about/) page and all
posts from 2025.  To save loading time, the discussions are normally hidden; to view them,
click on the **> Discussions** link at the bottom of the page.  You will
be asked to log into GitHub to post a comment.

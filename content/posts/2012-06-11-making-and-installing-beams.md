The last week and half has been taken up with making the floor beams
and installing them.  The beams in this house are 15 foot long
sandwiches made from two 2x10s with a 2x4 nailed in between them.  Our
house has 22 of these beams on the first floor, so there was a lot of
fabrication to be done.  It was a rainy week and we didn't have a
sheltered work area near the house site, so we took a couple of days
to disassemble a 22x14 hoop greenhouse down by the road and move it up
close to the house site.  This gave us a good dry place to
build and store beams.

The next step was to install the beams on the sill plates.  We started
with the one story section
because it was simpler than the two story section.  The beams are
about 40 inches apart (on center) on average, but we made adjustments
here and there to account for slight variations in their width.

Getting the beams up onto the sill plates was quite a chore because
they are so heavy.  It's possible to do it with two people but it's
much easier with three.  We did the one story section with just the
two of us.  We set up two ladders on opposite sides of the house, near
where the ends of a beam would be placed.  I would hold one end of the
beam while my partner would climb a ladder holding the other end of
the beam and place it on the sill plate.  Then she would hurriedly
come down and repeat the lifting on the other ladder while I held that
end of the beam over my head.

The second story section was much more difficult for several reasons.
First, five of the beams had ends that were not supported by
foundation walls, at the junction between the one story section and
the two story section.  For those five beam ends that were placed in
this gap, we had to make support posts
and brace them to keep them from falling over.  This took a lot of careful
measuring and planning, and some tricky work with ladders to set beams
on the posts.  We stretched a string across the gap as a continuation
of the chalk line we had laid out on the sill plates to ensure
accurate placements of the beams.

There were also some fiddly bits having to do with spacing two of the
beams far enough apart for the staircases, and making sure there was a
one inch space between the one story section and the two story
section.

We're still far from having a roof over our heads, but somehow having
the beams in place made it seem much more like a real house than did
the bare foundation.

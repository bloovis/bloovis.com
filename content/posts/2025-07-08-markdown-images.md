When I converted this site's Hugo themes to Hextra and Gallery, I was determined
to find a way to insert image links into posts, where clicking on
a small image would link to the full-sized image.  I also wanted
a caption to appear under the image.  It turns out there is a way
to do this with Markdown, but the necessary information wasn't
all in one place, and I had to piece it together.

First, it's simple enough to include an inline image using
Markdown.  For example:

```markdown
![alt](image-url)
```

Here, `alt` is the text that appears instead of the image if the
`image-url` is invalid.

But how to put a caption under the image?  Simply insert the caption
string in quotes after `image-url`:

```markdown
![alt](image-url "Caption")
```

The final problem: how to make this image be a link to a larger image.
The solution is to put brackets around the Markdown code for
the smaller image, and append the URL for the larger image in parentheses:

```markdown
[![alt](small-image-url "Caption")](large-image-url)
```

Here's a slightly modified example from an earlier post:

[![Dead Tree](/gallery/grouse-lakes/IMG_20250707_111612_526_hu_7ae287b424bb764a.jpg "Not a flower")](/gallery/grouse-lakes/IMG_20250707_111612_526.jpg)

The code for the above image looks like this (shown on two lines for clarity):

```markdown
[![Dead Tree](/gallery/grouse-lakes/IMG_20250707_111612_526_hu_7ae287b424bb764a.jpg "Not a flower")]
 (/gallery/grouse-lakes/IMG_20250707_111612_526.jpg)
```

Here is the breakdown of this code:

* The string "Dead Tree" is the text that would appear if the image
were missing or inaccessible.

* The very long image filename with the `_hu_...` modification
is a thumbnail image generated by the Gallery theme. This is the image that appears
above.

* The string "Not a flower" is the caption that appears under
the image, and also appears when hovering the mouse cursor over the image.

* The image filename without the `_hu_...` modification is the full-sized image,
which appears when you click on the thumbnail image or its caption.

*That was then:*

"So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing
we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified
terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."

--Franklin D. Roosevelt

"I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration."

--Frank Herbert, *Dune*

*This is now:*

"Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked,
and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger."

--Hermann Göring

"You never let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that it's an opportunity
to do things you think you could not do before."

--Rahm Emanuel

Greetings, jabbinated pfaithful!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness are proud
to announce that segregation and discrimination are back in style, and they're
better than ever!  That's right -- excluding people from society based on
unscientific bigotry is new and improved, and you can help implement it
in your community.

<!--more-->

The idea is very simple: we want to ostracize and shame people who don't
comply with our plan to get everybody on the planet to inject an untested,
experimental Glorious Goo.  It's not because the Glorious Goo will keep
you healthy -- far from it!  But that's not important.  What's important
is that we can tell who's a Good and Loyal Subject -- and not a No-Good Very Bad Granny-Killing
Conspiracy Theorist -- by seeing whether they comply with us and inject the Glorious Goo.
What could be simpler? We don't have to see what color their skin is, or know what
their religion is.  We just have to look at their Glorious Goo injection card!

Here's how you can help: Just make sure that your business excludes those who
have not taken the Glorious Goo.  It won't stop anybody who enters your business
from getting the Worst Disease Ever, but you'll have eliminated those who
aren't as obedient as you, and you'll feel virtuous and civic-minded at the
same time.

It's especially important for you to practice this form of medical apartheid
if you run a music venue.  As we've mentioned before in a previous propaganda
message, music gives people a great sense of shared pleasure, and that's the last
thing we want to give to those who don't comply with our made-up rules.
We're very proud of those music venues that have already implemented our
new and improved segregation, like

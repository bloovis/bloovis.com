I continued to install more sheathing boards (1x6 pine t&g) until I
ran out of wood about 1/3 of the way through the east roof. Otherwise
it’s done. Here’s a partial view of the interior:

Rather than waiting to overcome my laziness about driving 45 minutes
to the lumber yard, I decided to do some more work on the house wrap.
This layer goes over the sheathing.

When my ex and I built our Vermont house, we installed the sheathing
and house wrap working from the bottom up to the roof peak, which
meant working on roof ladders eventually. I wanted to avoid getting on
the roof at least one time, so I installed the roof sheathing from the
top down. I was able to do this standing on a folding ladder inside
the house. After installing three feet of sheathing, I tacked down a
long strip of house wrap to the upper part of the roof. I’ll have to
work on the roof to put on the insulation and the siding, but at least
I didn’t have to this time. I hate working on roofs — too dangerous
and scary.

Today I tacked up some more house wrap. This part is pretty easy; the
stuff is light and easy to hold in place while using a hammer stapler.

The rough openings around the windows are ugly and need to be trimmed,
so we've started that project in a serious way this past week.  We
have 35 windows in the house, so this is going to be a lot of work.
Each window takes anywhere from five to eight boards to trim it,
depending on which wall of the house it's on and how oversized the
rough opening is.  We're using leftover pine sheathing to make the
boards, and each board has to be cut and ripped to a custom size
(because of slight variations in rough opening size).  We're also
sanding each visible surface and applying a couple of coats of PolyWhey for
moisture protection.

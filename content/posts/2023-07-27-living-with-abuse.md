Two months before the March Madness of 2020, when the world went crazy
over the Worst Disease Ever, I escaped from an abusive relationship
after three years of failed attempts and confusion.  (I believe
this experience helped immunize
me against the Curve-Flattening Crazies.)

During the last few months before my escape, I started writing about
my experience in a secret blog, which I
showed to a very few trusted friends and relatives.  To keep it
hidden, I never linked to it anywhere on the public web (I shared
it on a private forum).  After three years
of secrecy, I'm now going
to put this blog on display for all to read.  You can find the archive
of posts [here](https://wordblast.nfshost.com/archive/index.html).
A good place to start there would be the
[Book-Throwing Incident](https://wordblast.nfshost.com/2019/05/31/book-throwing-incident.html).
That was the event that told me I
needed to get serious about escaping;
it took me another year and half to do that.

The most important advice I can offer to those who are in
an abusive relationship is to leave as soon as possible, but
to do it in a well-planned way so that you can leave safely.
This means you must:

* *not* reveal your plans to the abuser
* have a safe haven waiting for you after you escape
* have a secret stash of money to use for your escape
* have a secret cell phone (I used a cheapo flip-phone)
* have a secret credit card

The first time I tried to escape, I didn't do any of these things. I
got sucked back into the relationship, and wasted another 2.5 years
hoping things would get better.  Learn from my mistake: don't waste
time and energy on hopium.

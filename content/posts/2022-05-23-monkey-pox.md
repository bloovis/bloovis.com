Greetings, fearful hypochondriacs!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness are about to unleash a new fear
campaign about a disease that's been around for a while without scaring you.
We learned from the last two years that we can get you do anything we want
by using non-stop lies and fear porn.  So here's what you can expect
in the near future about this new Scary Thing.

<!--more-->

Yes, we know we got you all excited about a country that
you couldn't even find on a map until last month.  But it appears your interest
in that country is waning, so pay attention to the latest thing -- monkeypox!

We'll be sure to get the mainstream media to scare you with all sort of stories
about how cases are doubling every week and there's no stopping it now!

What we like about this new plague is that we can inundate you with scary images
of what it can do to you, even though some of those images are stock photos
of shingles.  (Fun fact: shingles are one of the adverse events from the
experimental gene therapy jabs you got last year for the Worst Disease Ever.)

You can be sure that we'll trot out the usual "experts" to make this seem just
as bad as -- or even worse than! -- the Worst Disease Ever from the last two
years.  As before, these experts will tell you that they have a plan
for keeping you safe, which will require your total obedience to every
nonsensical "rule" they make up or every experimental injection they say
you need.

We're also going to make you do lots and lots of testing, like
we did with the Worst Disease Ever, because you can't tell if
you're sick by feeling sick.  You might be sick without even knowing it!

Experts like Bill Gates (a college dropout with no medical experience) and
Dr. Fauci (who has never treated a patient) will start feeding you lies
about the origin of this scary thing so that you won't notice they've been
planning the fear campaign for years.

We'll pretend that this scary thing is unstoppable unless you take a new
experimental Glorious Goo, and we'll make you feel virtuous for being
an unpaid experimental subject.

So sit back, watch the TV, get more and more afraid, and be comforted
by the fact that we'll handle this made-up crisis in the same incompetent,
criminally harmful, and rights-destroying way we did with the Worse Disease Ever.

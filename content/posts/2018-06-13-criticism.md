The following explains much of the commentary on Youtube and other
forums on the internet:

"Men who are famous for their talent, great poets, eminent historians,
are always, or almost always, envied by those whose particular pleasure
and entertainment is judging other people's writings without ever having
brought anything of their own into the light of day."

-- Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, Second Part, Chapter III

title: ThinkPad T450s Noisy Fan and Thermal Paste

The fan on my main laptop, a ThinkPad T450s, can get pretty noisy at times,
especially when watching videos or doing a Zoom call.  The CPU temperatures
climb up pretty high at the same time, so the fan is trying to do its job.
But lately the noise and fan speed were getting annoying.  On a Zoom call, the
fan was always on high speed and very noisy.  I started to wonder if
the heat sink/fan assembly wasn't doing its job well enough.

I found a hint in [this post](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T-series-Laptops/Help-T450s-heat-spreader-doesn-t-cover-CPU/m-p/5196481)
on a Lenovo forum, where a T450s owner discovered that there was thermal paste on
only one of the two chips under the heat sink.  So yesterday I took apart
my T450s and discovered the same thing.  I'm going to assume that smaller
of the two chips, the one without thermal paste, was the GPU, *not* the
CPU, but I don't know for sure.

In any case, I wiped the old thermal paste off of the heat sink and
the one chip that had some paste, and applied some Arctic MX-6 to both
chips.  The result so far seems encouraging.  On a Zoom call later
in the day, the fan stayed on the lower, quieter speed almost the whole time,
and sped up briefly only once that I noticed.

This makes me wonder why Lenovo didn't apply thermal paste to both chips.
It seems like a serious manufacturing error.

For reference, here is an image from the Hardware Maintenance Manual for
the T450s, showing the fan assembly:

The instructions tell you to remove the screws 2a through 2f in order.
On my system, only screws 2a through 2d were present, but I removed them
in that order, and reinstalled them in the reverse order.  Thankfully, the screws
are captive, so they don't fall out when loosened all the way.

Greetings, obedient goodthinkers!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness
are proud of all those "Hate Has No Home Here" lawn signs you've
installed to show that you are a right-thinking virtuous person.
But we don't want you to go *too* far with that idea.
There are some people that you *must* hate, and we're
going to tell you how to do that.

<!--more-->

So how do you identify all those people that you must hate?
Simple! They're the ones who aren't as obedient as you are.  They're
the ones who:

* Refused to take our Glorious Goo for the Worst Disease Ever,
saying the Goo caused more harm than good.
* Claimed that masks don't work.
* Claimed that PCR tests are unreliable.
* Claimed that lockdowns harmed more people than they helped.
* Complained about censorship and the destruction of other inalienable rights.

It doesn't matter if these things are true or not.  What matters
is that they contradict our propaganda, and consequently they 
might make you feel doubtful, or worse yet, regretful about your obedience.
We can't let doubt or regret interfere with your obedience, and the best way
to deal with that problem is to hate those people who incited your doubt or regret.

First of all, you must express your hate by calling the hated people
names.  Here are just a few examples:

* Anti-vaxxer
* Conspiracy theorist
* Granny killer
* Murderer
* Right-wing extremist
* Anti-science nutjob
* Rights zealot
* Racist
* Selfish narcissist
* Filthy plague rat

Then you must express the things you'd like to do to those
terrible badthinkers:

* Lock them up
* Let them die
* Fire them from their jobs
* Fine them
* Censor everything they say online
* Prevent them from buying food
* Prevent them from going to concerts or museums
* Prevent them from flying on airplanes or using public transportation
* Deny them medical treatment
* Send them to quarantine camps
* Shoot them

Use social media to spread this good kind of hatred, and revel in
all the "likes" you'll get from other goodthinkers!

If you had any of those badthinkers as friends, you must stop
being their friend and tell them how much you hate them.  Use
any of the phrases we mentioned above, or invent your own.

So yes, hate *does* have a home here!  You just have to find
the right people to hate.

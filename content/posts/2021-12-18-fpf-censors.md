[Front Porch Forum](https://frontporchforum.com/) is a social network
that is popular in Vermont.  It is essentially a set of mailing lists,
one for each town group in the state.  It's useful for posting event
notices, or selling things, or asking for help.

FPF is also censors anything that contradicts the Covid fear narrative.  If you
regurgitate propaganda and fear porn from the Vermont Department of Health or the CDC, you're fine.
If you try to post a message containing factual information that 
points out the lies and deceit from the DOH and the CDC, you will be censored,
because you violated the [FPF Covid-19 Content Policy](https://frontporchforum.com/covid19policy).
There is no recourse, because the policy is entirely arbitrary.  FPF merely
has to claim that you are providing "false or misleading" information in order
to justify shutting you down.

Below are three posts that I submitted to FPF.  The first was approved, and
the second and third were were censored.  All three deal with the insanity
of using a PCR test to define the *false and misleading* notion of "case".

My first post was approved, quite to my surprise.  It
was written in response to a fear-mongering message about rising "cases" written by my
town's "Covid Response Team".  That team appears to be a propaganda channel
comprised of some frightened and deluded residents of my town.  Here is the post:

> My concern about the state's data for towns is that people may be

Here is the first censored post, written to clarify my earlier, approved post:

Here is the second censored post, written in response to more fear-mongering from the
"Covid Response Team" about the super-scary Omicron variant:

> I would like to remind my neighbors again not to be unnecessarily
> frightened by the latest statistics. The state defines "case" and
> "infection" to mean a positive PCR test. Until we know the

> Finally, it's worth remembering that the overall IFR (infection

> mind-killer."

*Update 2021-12-25:* I wrote back to the FPF, asking them to tell me
which parts of my two censored posts violated their Covid Content Policy.
They did not reply.  I can only assume that they are choosing
not to respond because they would then need to use facts and logic.

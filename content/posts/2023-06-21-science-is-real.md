There's a lawn sign that I see on my regular walks through the rural outskirts
of our little town here in Virtuous Vermont:

![Virtue Signalling Lawn Sign](/images/science-is-real-sign.jpg)

A Nice Person could hardly dare to disagree with any
of the noble sentiments expressed so eloquently on this sign.  I must not
be a very nice person, therefore, because I now see parts of this sign as a reality-denying
virtue signal.  In particular, the slogans "SCIENCE IS REAL" and "KINDNESS IS
EVERYTHING" were certainly belied by the actions of ordinary lawn-sign-owning
Good Citizens over the last three-plus years.

**SCIENCE IS REAL**: What does this mean, exactly?  Science used to be
thought of as a method for learning about and understanding the nature of reality.  As
such, the theories and explanations it created were always subject to
challenge, skepticism, revision, and replacement.  But I'm pretty sure
the SCIENCE represented on this lawn sign is what I like to refer to
sarcastically as The Science™: an authoritative-sounding but
fraudulent set of dogmatic statements crafted as propaganda in the
service of government control.  This is the fact-free Science™ that
told us that natural immunity wasn't real; that a cloth mask could
stop an aerosol-borne respiratory virus; that SARS-CoV-2 was so deadly
that we had to stay locked up in our homes and stand six feet apart
from other people; that the only thing that could save us was an
experimental mRNA drug that had never before been used successfully on
humans, that had no long-term safety data, and that was never
tested to see whether it could stop transmission.  This is The
Science™ that could tolerate no dissent, no challenges, and no
revision.  The popular slogan, Trust the Science™, was a command and
an implicit threat to skeptics and the non-compliant dissenters.

**KINDNESS IS EVERYTHING**:  I'd be willing to bet that the Nice People
displaying this lawn sign forgot about this particular slogan when
they were told by politicians and health officials like Dr. Fauci to not allow non-compliant
family members and friends into their homes.  They took to Twitter and Facebook
to repeat the idea that this was a "Scamdemic of the Unvaccinated", that
the unvaccinated were the problem, that the unvaccinated were anti-science right-wing
conspiracy-theorizing murderers who should be locked out of normal society.  Thus
the KINDNESS represented by this sign probably means KINDNESS ONLY TO THOSE
WHO ARE COMPLIANT LIKE US.

The insanity of the last three years, exemplified by lawn signs like this,
is the reason why I no longer want to be a part of "normal" society.  Besides,
"normal" society doesn't want me anyway.  I'm still shut out of venues
that I used to pay good money to enter. I regularly hear friends of
friends (who don't know I'm a non-compliant granny killer)
talking about how much they distrust and shun the unvaccinated.
My mother refuses to hug me now.  My circle of real-life close friends is now
small enough to be counted on one hand, with my thumb left over for
other purposes.

But all this is not such a bad thing in the long run.  The scamdemic
opened my eyes even wider to Reality.  The world has turned upside
down, so that my supposed allies turned out to be my enemies, and vice
versa.  However, I realize that "enemy" is perhaps too strong word here.  To
keep from going over too far into the nihilist camp, I have to tell
myself that my former best friend who called me a murderer and a
conspiracy theorist isn't really my enemy: she was brainwashed by
ubiquitous propaganda, as were the people displaying the lawn sign above.

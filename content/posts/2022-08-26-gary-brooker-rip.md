I just learned that Gary Brooker, the co-founder of Procol Harum,
died six months ago.  He was one of the finest songwriters
in the rock genre.  His lyricist for most of his songs was Keith Reid.
The original band had other fine musicians, notably B. J. Wilson (drums),
Robin Trower (guitar), and Matthew Fisher (organ).

[Here he is performing his most famous song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQyFixb54JU),
with Matthew Fisher playing his iconic Bach-like organ counterpoint to Gary's vocals.
Note the extra verse in the middle.  The song as originally composed
had four verses by Keith Reid, bringing the length to nearly ten
minutes.  This was much too long for a single in the 60s, so it was
shortened to two verses for that purpose.

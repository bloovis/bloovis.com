Hello, useless eaters!  As your unqualified, non-elected global human health overlord, 
I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence
over society, and share some of my plans for you and your future.

<!--more-->

When I amassed my fortune in computer software, I demonstrated that I was willing
to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monopolistic control to
destroy my competitors.  Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a
humanitarian.  With my for-profit foundation masquerading as a charity, I
can advocate for population reduction, and sponsor mass human experiments with
unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations.

Like my father -- a powerful banker, eugenecist, and Rockefeller crony himself --
it's always been my ambition to decide who lives, and more importantly, how
many have to die.  Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world
health, it's really all about controlling and culling the human herd for
fun and profit.

In November of last year, I hosted Event 201, a war-game simulation of
a global pandemic.  Leaders from private corporations, global banks,
governments, and the media got together to strategize ways they could
align in lock-step when responding to a world-wide health crisis.
Using a coordinated campaign of fear-mongering, intimidation, social shaming,
and economic blackmail, we realized we could get around dangerous philosophies,
like individual liberty and national sovereignty.  With an obedient population,
we would be free to implement our own top-down solutions, like forced quarantines,
social distancing, contact tracing, and mandatory testing, as a means to
seize technocratic control of society.

Now imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to release -- uh, *declare*
our own global pandemic.  It was my chance to look like the Nostradamus of
public health, and to position myself, and business partners like Dr. Fauci,
as the de-facto authorities on response and solutions.  Through exaggerated
doomsday scenarios and computer simulations, our petty control freaks instituted
harsh rules and draconian lockdowns.  Even after our dire predictions proved false,
scared and well-meaning people continued to submit to the arbitrary and foolish
demands of their so-called leaders.

Having achieved global lockdown and medical martial law, we'll continue to hold
hostage your ability to congregate, work, travel, or do just about anything
until we're prepared to roll out our bigger plan.  I'd like to call this Pandemic One,
because believe me, we have others in the works.

Our final solution is to have you begging for us to vaccinate, tag, and digitally track
each one of you, like livestock.  Not only will my foundation enjoy legal immunity,
and trillions in profits, but these mandatory, experimental vaccines will
move us so much further down the road to absolute centralized global control.
If only my good friend Jeffrey Epstein had been here to celebrate with me
aboard the Lolita Express.

So remember, global citizens: this will end when I say it ends.
Could be a year, maybe two years, maybe never!  I guarantee that if
we have our way, it'll be at least until you're not able to do
anything to stop it.  Just surrender your personal freedom and common
sense to our fear merchants, and government, and the media -- because none
of this works unless you all go along with it.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to do some augmented reality spirit
cooking with Marina AbramoviÄ‡.  Bye now!

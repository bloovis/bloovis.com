Greetings, fearful news junkies!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness
want you to become more familiar with the Big Lies that form
the foundation of our plans for the eventual total control of your lives.
Your familiarity with these lies will help us to suppress any information
that contradicts these lies.  We couldn't do it without you!

Here, in brief, are the Big Lies that we've been propagating far and
wide every day for the last 2+ years:

* **SARS-CoV-2 is the Worst Virus Ever, and thus has created the Worst Disease Ever.**

    Now, of course we know that the Worst Disease Ever is a bit worse than a bad flu for the elderly and the sick, and much
    less bad than the flu for everybody else.  But we have lied by omission about
    this fact, in order to get you to believe that you have a 50/50 chance of
    dying if you get the Worst Disease Ever.  We're not going to correct your
    misunderstanding of the risk, because we want you to remain fearful at all times.

* **All of our NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) like lockdowns, masks, and
anti-social distancing did wonders for stopping the Worst Disease Ever.**

    Now, of course anybody who compares countries or states who did NPIs with those
    that didn't knows that the NPIs did nothing.  But that's OK.  Our goal is to
    train people to go along with every silly mandate and rule that we pull out
    of a hat.  And so far, we've had great success with that -- so great that many
    of you still go along with these silly mandates and rules even after they've
    been lifted.  This means it'll be easier for us to get you to comply in the future.

* **People who aren't sick are walking biohazards.**

    That's right: even if you're feeling just great, you could be a reservoir of deadly
    viruses that are just waiting to leap out of your mouth and kill granny.
    Now, of course Dr. Fauci once said that asymptomatic transmission has never
    been the driver of respiratory virus outbreaks.  But that was a temporary lapse
    of judgment on his part.  He soon got with the program and has been dispensing
    our brand of non-stop fear ever since.

* **PCR tests can tell you if you're sick.**

    As we mentioned earlier, you're still a plague rat even if you're totally healthy.
    So you need to take PCR tests -- *lots* of tests -- to see if you're sick.
    Now, of course the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, said that his test
    can't actually tell if you're sick or going to be sick.  But he's dead and
    can't contradict our lie.  What's really great about the test is that, as with the NPIs
    we mentioned earlier, it keeps you fearful and anxious.  And we've turned up the
    fear knob to 11 by allowing PCR tests to use super-high cycle thresholds, which means
    that the false positive rates are through the roof.  This way, you'll think
    you're a granny killer at all times.  But see the next Big Lie; it's a way to
    escape your plague rat status.

* **The Glorious Goo is safe and effective.**

    As we mentioned earlier, in 2020 we told you that everybody was a walking biohazard.  But in 2021
    we gave you a way to feel safe and virtuous: by injecting a Glorious Goo
    gene therapy that we tricked you into thinking would make you immune
    to the Worst Disease Ever.  So now you can pretend that you're no
    longer a granny killer, and that only those who refuse to take the Glorious
    Goo are the real granny killers.  Of course, the Glorious Goo isn't actually
    safe and effective, which means that not only can you still catch the
    Worst Disease Ever, but you can also pass it on to granny, and it could
    also harm you.  But we can't let you know that, because that would be bad for Big Pharma's profits,
    and bad for our plan for total control.  So just be reassured that
    the Goo is safe and effective, despite all evidence to the contrary.

Now that you know what the Big Lies are, you are ready to spread them
far and wide on social media.  Also, be sure to use the following key phrases as you praise
your fellow obedient serfs, and shame and censor those who disagree with you:

* The Worst Disease Ever isn't over yet.
* The Glorious Goo is Safe and Effective.
* I got the Worst Disease Ever, but it would have been Much Worse without the Glorious Goo.
* A mask is no big deal, just a piece of cloth.
* I liked lockdowns, because I got to work from home.

(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post.)

I'm probably being selfish and whiny when I continue to complain about
medical apartheids that affect me personally -- in particular, the one
implemented by the [Sonata Piano Camp](https://www.sonatina.com/sonata).
I have not lost my job or my health due to mandates.
But music is a big part of my life, and the piano camp was a great
experience for me.
It was inspiring to be around other amateurs,
of all different skill levels.  After I attended for the first
time in 2005, I returned four more times.

For the 2022 programs, Sonata instituted a new policy requiring experimental
mRNA injections for all attendees. (I refuse to call these injections
"vaccines", since they do not confer immunity, nor do they
prevent transmission or infection.)  I told myself that they
would wake up to reality in 2023, but that hasn't happened.
The same policy is being enforced for next year.  Here it is:

> For the 2023 season, proof of COVID vaccination will be required. To attend camp, we require the initial doses of any of the COVID vaccines. In addition, for optimized safety, we strongly prefer that campers and staff are up to date on all recommended booster vaccines,especially the bivalent booster.
>
> A negative COVID test result immediately prior to departure for camp will be required for attendance.

I have great respect for the people who run this camp, but this policy tells me
they have become fearful and irrational, no doubt due to three years of
fear porn from governments and mass media.  Their policy is both
unscientific and unethical.

Since medical apartheid is clearly unethical, as confirmed by such documents
as the Nuremberg Code, let's look at the unscientific aspect of this policy.  The first thing
that struck me is that it allows people who got jabbed almost two
years ago to attend.  Any efficacy that these jabs may have provided
has surely vanished by now, and would probably not do anything for the
swarms of mutated viruses circulating now.  Thus, these people would
now be just as much a vector for these viruses as those who have not
been injected.  So this policy can only be interpreted as an
enforcement of compliance with a fear-based tyranny, and not as a health measure.

Also, you still have to get tested in order to attend, despite having been injected.
So the injections are both effective and ineffective at the same time.  The
cognitive dissonance, it burns!

(I'm leaving out the obvious fact that the "pandemic" was completely
oversold, and that the injections could barely be justified for most
people even if they had worked as advertised.)

Injection mandates like this are irrational
in any case.  Consider these possibilities:

* If the injections confer protection from a virus,
then those who have been injected should have nothing to worry about from
others, even those who have not been injected.  Thus, the mandate
is unnecessary.

* If the injections do *not* confer protection, then the mandate
will not help the situation, so it is, once again, unnecessary.

Apologists for the injection mandates will respond by saying
that even *partial* protection is worth *something*, and that this
uncharacterized *something* needs to be supported by mandates.  But the apologists
can never point to any data supporting this position.  How
much of a *something* is it, exactly?  Does the injection
provide 50% protection against transmission and infection? 25%?
10%?  The apologists don't know and they don't care.  They
are driven by fear, and by an irrational faith in a magic
rabbit's food in the form of an experimental injection.

In fact, we now know that those who have been injected
can and do become infected and can transmit the virus
that the injection was supposed to suppress.  The CDC
has even acknowledged this fact by stating that the injected
and uninjected should be treated the same.  But that
does not matter to the fearful people who run
classical music events in Vermont.

Even if the Sonata Piano Camp were to eliminate their
unethical medical apartheid, I do not think I could
ever trust them again.  They would be likely to
reinstitute the apartheid at the least sign of
"increased cases", or some other fear porn dispensed
by the government and media.

We dissidents often say that we have to create alternative, parallel
societies and institutions to work around the corrupt and tyrannical
ones that dominate our world now.  That's a huge task.  In the world
of classical music, it is especially daunting, since it appears that
most musicians in this field have become full-fledged members of the
Covid cult.  For me, piano playing will once again become a mostly
solitary activity.  I think the best I can hope for now is to continue
to share music with the very small handful of friends that I still
have left.  (I use the word "handful" literally, because I can count
these friends on one hand.)

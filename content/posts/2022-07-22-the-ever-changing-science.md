Greetings, jabbinated germophobes!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness want
you to not be alarmed by the fact that both Dr. Science™ (aka Tony Fauci)
and Uncle Brandon (aka Joe Biden) have somehow gotten infected by
the Worst Disease Ever, despite being jabbed up the wazoo with the Glorious Goo.

Yes, we know, a year ago Uncle Brandon said this couldn't possibly happen:

</iframe>

But that was a year ago! A lot of Science™ can change in a year!

Maybe it's all the fault of the filthy unclean antivaxxer plague rats.
Maybe it's some new scariant causing a "breakthrough infection" (please don't
say "jab failure").  Maybe it's climate change making people
more susceptible.  Maybe not enough people are jabbed.  Maybe not
enough people are wearing masks.  Our best sciency scientific
scientists are baffled, but rest assured they're working on the
problem night and day.

In any case, we're sure it would have been *much* worse without the jab.
So get your <del>booster</del> update ASAP and trust the Science™!

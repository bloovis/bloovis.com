The wildflowers were out in force today on my usual weekly hike to
Upper Rock Lake for a swim. The trail starts at 5700 feet and climbs
to around 6800 feet as it loops around Bowman Mountain. The loop is
around eight miles— not sure exactly. The flowers are different every
week, but I think they’re at their peak right now.

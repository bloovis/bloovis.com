At the beginning of last week, we spent a couple of days raising the
rafter goal posts for
the one story section of the house.

We'd already built the components
(posts and rafters) over the previous week or two.  Raising the one
story rafters is a bit like raising the goal posts for the two story
section: nail the rafters to the posts flat on the deck, then raise
the assembled units and drop them into the post holes along the edge of the deck.  We
had two or three helpers each day.  It's best to have two people on
each side as you walk the rather top-heavy assembly along the deck to
the post holes.  We raised the first three with only three people,
though, by using a rope tied to the collar tie and a person on the
second floor pulling on the rope.

The plumbing and squaring process went more smoothly this time because
we knew better what we were doing.  With the two story goal post
raising, we decided to not fully nail the beams to the posts to make
them easier (supposedly) to plumb and square after raising.  But this
turned out to be a mistake, because it made squaring the goal posts
much more difficult -- a two day process, as it turned out, because of
the need to detach and reattach numerous braces to get things square.

With the one story section, we squared up the goal posts as accurately
as possible with the assemblies lying on the deck, and fully nailed
the joints.  Then after raising, the goal posts were plumb in the
short (15 foot) direction without any extra fiddling.  This left only
the need to brace the goal posts to be plumb in the long (30 foot)
direction, which was easily accomplished with diagonal braces on the
posts, then horizontal braces along the tops of the collar ties to get
the spacing between rafters correct.

Getting the final bit of the house frame up gave us a huge sense of
accomplishment, and we took it easy for a day or two afterwards.  Then
we started the big push to get the whole house sheathed so
we can get the roof on as soon as possible.

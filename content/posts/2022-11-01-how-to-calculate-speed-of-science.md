Greetings, worshipers of The Science™!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness want
to explain what one of our propaganda dispensers meant when she said
that we created the Glorious Goo at the
[Speed of Science™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnxlxzxoZx0).
We know that The Science™ is really hard for you pea-brains to understand,
so all you really need to know is that the Speed of Science™ is really,
really fast.  It's unimaginably fast!  But if you want to know
the mathy mathiness about how fast that is, keep reading.  We'll
try to keep the math simple for you simpletons.

As we all know, the more money that the government gives to the virtuous
and selfless and heroic scientists here at the Ministry of Truthiness, the faster The Science™
will be. We can express this using the following super-simple and sciency equation:

V<sub>s</sub> = K &times; ( $ &divide; T )

V<sub>s</sub> is the Velocity (fancy word for speed) of Science™.

K is a krazy konstant that we just made up and change whenever we feel like it
to ensure that our sciency scientists don't run out of money.

$ is dollars.

T is time in seconds.

So this equation is saying: the more dollars per second that we get,
the faster our Science™ goes.  Simple, right?  The equation is also saying
that Science™ is a unit that is expressed in dollars per second.  This is only
right, because without dollars, our Science™ wouldn't exist at all!

The takeaway message here is that you need to give us even more dollars,
because we're the only ones that can stop the Worst Disease Ever, or the Even Worstest
Worst Diseases Ever that might be heading our way this winter.  Your tax dollars
help, but you can help even more by injecting yourself with the Glorious Goo.  Each
injection you take sends more science dollars to our super-sciency scientists.
Donate generously!

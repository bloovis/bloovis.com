The Workplace Mental Health Institute has a [handy infographic](https://www.thewmhi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Abusive-Relationship-Infographic.pdf)
about abusive relationships.  Here it is in text form:

You may be in an abusive relationship if they:

1. Stop you seeing friends and family.
2. Won't let you go out without permission.
3. Tell you what to wear.
4. Monitor your phone or emails.
5. Control the finances, or won't let you work.
6. Control what you read, watch, and say.
7. Monitor everything you do.
8. Punish you for breaking the rules, but the rules keep changing.
9. Tell you it is for your own good, and that they know better.
10. Don't allow you to question it.
11. Tell you you're crazy, and no one agrees with you.
12. Call you names or shame you for being stupid or selfish.
13. Gaslight your, challenge your memory of events, make you doubt yourself
14. Dismiss your opinions.
15. Play the victim: if things go wrong, it's all your fault.

Totalitarian governments use these same techniques to control masses of people.
We've seen our own government devolve into this use of totalitarian abuse
over the last 18 months.  Using the above list as a guide, here's what
we've seen them do:

1. Tell us we can't see friends and family at Thanksgiving and Christmas.
2. We must isolate at home.
3. We must wear masks in public, and sometimes even in our own homes. Lately this has devolved into requiring the unclean lepers (i.e., the unvaccinated)
to wear masks, the better to make them stand out so that they can be shamed.
4. The government has threatened to filter out "misinformation" from text messages, and already Gmail
is marking messages from "misinformation sites" as spam.
5. The push to abolish cash and replace it with government-sanctioned cryptocurrency
will allow the government to monitor and control all of our spending.
6. The government uses Big Tech companies like Google and Facebook as their censors, so that users
of these services are blocked from seeing information that contradicts
the government narrative.
7. Government agencies like the NSA monitor all of our electronic communications,
and Big Tech has become, in essence, surveillance capitalism in the service of government.
8. Vaccine passports are very likely be rolled out in the near future, forbidding the unclean from
participating in normal society.  In the meantime, private business is doing the
government's work for it by instituting mask mandates and vaccination requirements.
The mask mandates, in particular, keep changing, so that now, instead of forcing
everybody to wear the muzzles, only the unclean have to wear them.
9. The government tells us that isolating, distancing, muzzling, and jabbing are good
for us, and even more virtuously, good for others.  Trust The Scienceâ„¢.
10. If we disagree with the government narrative, we must be censored,
shouted down, and told that we are anti-science.
11. If we disagree with the government narrative, we are deluded, ignorant conspiracy theorists,
and all good-thinking people disagree with us.
12. If we disagree with the government narrative, we are selfish, granny-killing
super-spreaders who deserve to be locked up.
13. Forget the previous definitions and science about "cases" and "asymptomatic transmission"
and even "pandemic".  Forget that we used to deal with respiratory virus outbreaks by
protecting the elderly and infirm, staying home if we were sick,
and letting everybody else go about their business.  Throw away all that common sense
and comply with a new lockdown system that has never been used successfully before.
14. If we disagree with the government narrative, we've obviously been brainwashed by spreaders
of misinformation who can't be trusted.
15. The new "breakthrough cases" are due to the inability of the new vaccines to stop
transmission or infection, but the government must deflect attention from these failures by blaming
those of us who have *not* been vaccinated, because we are selfish disease spreaders.

Greetings, lovers of The Science™!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness
want you to learn a very important truthy and scientific lie that we made up about
the Scary Virus that causes the Worst Disease Ever.  Armed with
this thruthy lie, you will be able to properly protect yourself using
plastic shields that would have looked ridiculous a few short years
ago, but which are totally great and sciency now.

The most important thing for you to know is that the Scary Virus can only travel in
straight lines.  If it meets a plastic shield, it is stopped dead in its tracks.
It can't go over, under, or around the shield.  This is true even though it travels in aerosol
particles that are smaller than smoke particles that *can* go around the shields.
That's the magic of The Science™: the laws of physics are different for different things,
depending how they align with our very truthy lies.

You can start protecting yourself against the Worst Disease Ever by constructing
a plastic cone that fits around your head, as seen in this picture:

For the most complete protection, you will need to wear this shield at
all times, even while showering, sleeping, or having sex.

If you operate a shop, and you find that the aforementioned plastic cone interferes
with your work efficiency, or that insensitive granny-killers are laughing at you,
you can protect yourself from the Worst Disease Ever
by installing a giant plastic shield on your counter that sits between you and your plague-ridden
patrons.  You can put a big hole in the shield to allow money to be passed
back and forth, because the Scary Virus is not
smart enough to see the hole.  Even in the unlikely event that the Scary Virus does see the hole,
it is polite enough to see that you wish to be protected, and it will honor your wish
by refusing to pass through the hole.

This is yet another example of the very sciency scientific Science™ that
we made up for our benefit, and to trick you into thinking we can keep
you safe.  Stay tuned for more exciting nuggets of Science™, and don't
forget to keep being afraid of the unknown in the meantime.

Greetings, worshipers of The Science™!  If you're still wearing a face diaper
in the delusional belief that it will stop the Worst Disease Ever, congratulations!
You've told the world that you're a good, virtuous, obedient right-thinker, while
simultaneously showing your approval of our New and Improved Science™.  This
great New Science™ isn't anything like the bad old science, so let's explore
what this means when you're trying to understand why you still have to
wear a face diaper.

First, you need to throw out everything you thought you learned about science
in school.  Forget about the fact that aerosol-borne viruses are much smaller than
the pores in a face diaper.  Size doesn't matter when it comes to The New Science™
of the Worst Virus Ever!   What matters is that you *believe* that what you're
doing is safe and effective, not whether it actually is in reality.

So let's look at the New Science™ of face diapers.  Remember how you
have to wear a face diaper when you're walking into a restaurant for 30 seconds,
but can take it off for the next hour while you're seated?  The bad old science
might tell you that wearing a face diaper for less than 1% of the time
in a restaurant isn't effective.  But the New Science™ has all sorts
of theories that will allay your tiny niggling bits of doubt:

* The Worst Virus Ever occupies a layer of the atmosphere that starts
at 4.5 feet above ground, and never goes below that point.
* The Worst Virus Ever can only detect a victim that is walking, and not sitting.
* The Worst Virus Ever is polite, and won't bother you while you're eating.
* The Worst Virus Ever knows you're afraid of it, and out of sheer kindness won't bother you.
* The Worst Virus Ever is repelled by food.

Now that we've got Restaurant Science™ out of the way, let's look at Music Science™.
Most musicians have no problem wearing face diapers, because they're using their
hands and/or feet.  But what about wind instruments?  That's simple: just cut
a big mouth hole in the diaper:

Yes, you probably noticed that the mouth isn't covered in this
picture.  But that's OK: all you have to do is make sure that you only
breathe in through your nose.  Of course, you're still spraying out
particles of the Worst Virus Ever through your instrument, but if
everybody else is wearing a face diaper, you're all protected.  (By
the way, that's another example of one of the basic rules of our
Useless Safety Measures: these measures don't work unless unless
absolutely everybody is obedient.)

Now let's look at some other situations.  You've probably seen all those
virtuous people who wear face diapers in their car with the windows
rolled up, or who wear face diapers while walking around outside
in bright sun with a breeze blowing.  The bad old science would say
you don't need protection in those situations, but the New Science™
says otherwise.  Remember, the face diaper is designed to remind
you to be afraid, and you should be!  The entire atmosphere of
our planet is saturated with the Worst Virus Ever, so you need to
protect yourself at all times.

How about social situations, like families in their homes?  There
again, you have to be afraid.  Everybody in the entire world
is a vector of the Worst Virus Ever, even your own kids -- and
even when they're not sick.  So you should wear a face diaper
at all times indoors, too, even in the shower:

Now you might have thought to yourself: even if my face diaper could
catch maybe 1% of the Worst Virus Ever coming out of my nose and
mouth, what happens to those viruses that *do* get caught?  Don't
worry your pretty little head about that -- The New Science™ is coming to
your rescue!  Obviously, you'd never want those viruses to survive in
ever growing numbers on your mucus-laden face diaper.  Think of how
many millions of those viruses would be sitting in your face diaper at
the end of the day, only millimeters from your precious bodily fluids!
So the face diaper must have some amazing virus-killing properties
that even our most sciency scientific scientists have yet to understand.

In summary, think of your face diaper like magic rabbit's foot, only better, because
it signals to the world that you are a Good Fearful Person.

Greetings, obedient serfs!  We super-sciency scientific scientists at
your local Public Health Department want to make sure you're still
showing your compliance with our nonsensical rules by continuing to
wear your snot-rag.

<!--more-->

Now, you may have noticed that we recently
relaxed our mandates about these worthless snot-rags, to fool you into
thinking we won't torture you again.  But don't worry!  At the least
sign of some future Terrible Crisis, like a new virus scariant, or
rising "cases" from false positives on high-Ct PCR tests, or a fuel
shortage, or bad weather, or smog, or wildfires in California, or
something, we'll tell you to wear a snot-rag again.  So keep wearing
one now and you won't have to be surprised again.

Besides, wearing a snot-rag shows you care.  OK, sure, the damn things
don't work, and even Dr. Fauci admitted as such before he started
lying on a daily basis.  And yes, it doesn't make sense that you have
to wear a snot-rag for thirty seconds while you're entering a
restaurant, but not for the subsequent sixty minutes while you're
seated.  But logic and common sense don't matter.  What's important is
that you want others to know that you are a virtuous person, and not a
granny-killing psychopath.

So mask up and be proud that you are a submissive, fearful, compliant,
right-thinking serf!

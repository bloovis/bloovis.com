Greetings, Pfizer Pfaithful!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness are
alarmed to hear that those anti-vaxxer, anti-science conspiracy theorists
are back, claiming that during the last three years, we coerced people into doing things
they didn't want to do.   We have checked with our Memory Hole Department,
and after sifting through the charred, unreadable remains of historical documents,
we can assure you absolutely no coercion ever happened!

We never forced you stay at home.  You had a choice: you could support the greater
good by cowering at home, or you could get fined or arrested.  No coercion there!

We never forced you to wear a mask.  You had a choice: you could support the greater
good by wearing a mask everywhere, even in your car, or you could get thrown
out of shops and other venues if you didn't comply.  No coercion there!

We never forced you to take the Glorious Goo.  You had a choice: you could
support the greater good by getting jabbed with the Glorious Goo multiple
times, or you could get thrown out of music venues, fired from your job,
or suffer a winter of severe illness and death.  No coercion there!

In short, you were free to comply with our demands or suffer the
consequences.  Your choice!  Isn't freedom wonderful?  Aren't you glad
you live in a free society?  You should be!  And you should be glad
that we at the Ministry of Truthiness supported that freedom with our
safe and effective Freedom Mandates.  We saved the world from the
Worst Disease Ever!  And we'll continue to save the world from
future Scary Threats.  The best is yet to come!

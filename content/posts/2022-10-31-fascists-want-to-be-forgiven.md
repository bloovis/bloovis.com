I'm turning off the sarcasm switch for this one again.

In this third year of the Covid Tyranny, we now have the spectacle of
media influencers like
[Emily Oster](https://www.eugyppius.com/p/emily-oster-proposes-a-pandemic-amnesty)
and
[Leana Wen](https://guttermouth.substack.com/p/im-sorry-youre-an-asshole-part-1),
who supported the tyranny vocally and stridently, asking for apologies now.
"We didn't that know that what we did was
so terrible.  Take pity on us and let's move on!" seems to be the message.

No.  We will not forgive you.  We *did* know very early on that the Dreaded Plague
was not the Apocalypse.  We knew that
[masks were useless and harmful](https://brownstone.org/articles/more-than-150-comparative-studies-and-articles-on-mask-ineffectiveness-and-harms/).
We knew that lockdowns had been previously rejected by pandemic planners as
being useless and harmful. We knew that Remdesivir and ventilators were killing
people. We knew that the magical mRNA jabs wouldn't prevent transmission
or infection and were actually
[killing and injuring people](https://openvaers.com/covid-data).

You fascists knew all that.  Yet you went on treating people who disagreed with
you like shit.  You shamed us, locked us in our homes, prevented us from
visiting sick friends and relatives in hospitals, closed our businesses
because they were arbitrarily deemed as "not essential", censored us
on social media, prevented us from traveling on airplanes, prevented
us from traveling to other countries, forced us to wear useless and harmful
masks nearly everywhere, told us we were selfish right-wing granny-killers,
prevented us from going to concerts, locked up playgrounds and beaches,
told us it was dangerous to touch or even be near other people,
tried to coerce us into injecting ourselves with poorly tested experimental drugs -- in
short, you made our lives miserable while you sat comfortably in your nice
houses and made money typing your virtuous screeds on your Macbooks.

So no, we will not forgive you.  Forgiveness requires that the criminal
apologize, make reparations, and promise not to commit the crime again.
I don't see you fascists doing any of that.  You have not apologized
for lying to us and abusing us for three years.  You have not worked
to make reparations to those who lost their livelihoods -- or *lives* --
to your fascistic mandates.  You have not agreed to punish those
who committed those crimes against humanity, probably because you supported
or even committed those crimes.  You have not promised to enact laws
to prevent those crimes from occurring in the future.

Let me make this really clear: until you apologize for your crimes, repair the damage you
have caused, and assure us that these crimes will not happen again, we will not forgive you.

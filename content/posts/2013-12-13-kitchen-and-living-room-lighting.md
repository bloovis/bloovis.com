We spent a lot of time and effort figuring out what kind of lighting
we wanted for the kitchen and living room, the 15x30 one story "great
room" with cathedral ceilings.  For kitchen work, track lighting with
spot bulbs looked like it would provide enough light.  But most track
lighting that you see in big box stores is ugly and bulky, because
it's typically a 120 volt system, and all that dangerous voltage has
to be hidden inside metal conduits.  Low voltage track lighting is
usually slimmer, but has the downside of requiring a bulky transformer
somewhere.  Then there are the fixtures themselves, which often have
an industrial look more suited for clothing stores.  After a long
search, we came across a monorail system made by [Tech
Lighting](http://www.techlighting.com/Products), which is pretty slim,
and has some whimsical fixtures as a nice bonus.  We installed one of
these systems in the [kitchen over the main counter](http://localhost:1313/gallery/firstday-cottage/IMG_2924.JPG)
area.  The
fixtures include a couple of
[dragonflies](/gallery/firstday-cottage/IMG_2925.JPG)
and three [metal men](/gallery/firstday-cottage/IMG_2926.JPG).

For the living room areas of the great room and the sink island, we
chose some pendants made by a [forge in
Vermont](http://www.hubbardtonforge.com/).  They were expensive, but
nothing else we looked at seemed as attractive.  Most lighting
companies use unnecessary frills to make their products look fancy,
but we wanted something simple.  We
[suspended the lights from the rafters](/gallery/firstday-cottage/IMG_2927.JPG),
with the electrical boxes hidden in wooden supports that we attached
to the collar ties. 

Power to the all the lights in the house is supplied by wires running up the posts and rafters in Wiremold raceways.  Using the raceways avoided the need to build wooden boxes, false walls, or other structures to hide the wires.

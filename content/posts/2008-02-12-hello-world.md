For several years I've been keeping a LiveJournal blog because LJ's social networking features make it convenient to keep up to date with friends.  But I also wanted to have a place to record discoveries and thoughts on subjects of little interest to my LJ friends, such as Linux  and programming languages.  So I've created this blog for that purpose.

I've also been using Flickr for photo storage, but I never found its social networking features as useful or interesting as LJ's.  Then right around the time that Microsoft announced its desire to swallow Yahoo! (and Flickr), my "pro" membership expired.   As a result, many of my photos and albums disappeared, and annoying ads reappeared.  So it seemed like a good time to abandon Flickr  and create my own [photo gallery](http://www.bloovis.com/gallery2/).

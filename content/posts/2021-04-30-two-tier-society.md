Even without vaccine passports, we are being nudged into a two-tier,
clean vs. unclean, caste society.  The CDC has issued guidance for
[choosing safer
activities](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/participate-in-activities.html),
and not surprisingly, the unvaccinated are asked to take demeaning,
anti-social prevention measures that the vaccinated do not have to
undergo.  Furthermore, the unvaccinated are described as "less safe"
or "least safe" if they attempt to participate in normal social
activities.

There is no logical reason for this segregation.  If the vaccines are
really as effective as is being claimed, vaccinated people should not
be in any danger.  But as we have seen over the past year, logic and
reason have had no place in the decisions made by our governments to
shut down society.

Despite the Biden administration's assurance that the federal
government will not mandate vaccine passports, it is becoming apparent
with each passing day that they will in fact be implemented -- whether
by private business or state governments is not clear yet.  We should
also remember that the federal government has not been exactly truthy
in the past, so its promise cannot be taken too seriously.

For a while now I've been publishing my free software projects
on Github.  But last month [Microsoft purchased Github](https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-buys-github-and-some-people-are-pissed-1826533362),
and that alarmed me.
Traditionally, Microsoft has been the mortal enemy of free software, and Linux
in particular.  The company now claims to be the friend of free software,
but trusting Microsoft, whose mission is total monopoly power,
is like trusting an abuser who claims to be reformed
and promises he will never hit you again.  So I've starting moving my projects
to Gitlab; see them [here](https://gitlab.com/users/bloovis/projects).

Cervantes on the weapons of war:
<!--more-->

"Happy were those blessed times that lacked the horrifying fury of the
diabolical instruments of artillery, whose inventor, in my opinion, is in
hell, receiving the reward for his accursed invention, which allows an ignoble
and cowardly hand to take the life of a valiant knight, so that not
knowing how it comes, or from where, a stray shot is fired into the
courage and spirit that inflame and animate a brave heart, sent by one
who perhaps fled in fear at the bright flare when the damned machine
dischared it, and cuts off and ends in an instant the thoughts and life
of one who deserved to enjoy many more long years.  When I consider this,
I am prepared to say that it grieves my very soul that I have taken up
the profession of knight errant in an age as despicable as the one we live
in now, for although no danger can cause me to fear, it still fills me with
misgivings to think that powder and tin may deprive me of the opportunity
to become famous and renowned throughout the known world for the
valor of my arm and the sharp edge of my sword."

-- Cervantes, *Don Quixote*, First Part, Chapter XXXVIII

What with all the excitement and alarm about artificial intelligence
these days, I thought I would fight back with a plea for Artificial
Stupidity.  Specifically, I believe we can do better than the stupidity
of the writing on most mainstream media by using computer-generated
stupidity.

You can get an idea of the possibilities here by
playing around with the [Postmodern Generator](https://www.elsewhere.org/journal/pomo/)
(reload the page to get new nonsense).

Then there's an earlier (from 2003) text generator by Jamie Zawinski
called [DadaDodo](https://www.jwz.org/dadadodo/).
This is a simple C program that can be compiled on just about any computer
these days.  For fun I tried using DadaDodo on the text of
[Moby Dick](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701), which I had read recently.
(Try reading *Moby Dick* out loud; it's better that way.) Here's the first
paragraph that DadaDodo generated:

> Starbuck, stood at least palpable semblance of having

> Wall, shoved up the ladder and over his own and Bildad

That's not too bad.  It's definitely Melville, but a Melville
with Biden-level intelligibility.  Prompted by this text,
I have scuttled the hemp.

As you can see, the possibilities are endless.  Not only could we
replace the aforementioned mainstream media with Artificial Stupidity,
but all political speech and bestselling novels could be written in
the same way.  The future is bright indeed!

After we sanded the floors, we were getting ready to apply the satin
[PolyWhey](https://vermontnaturalcoatings.com/product/polywhey-floor-finish/),
a whey-based low-toxicity polyurethane.  But we were delayed due to
injuries, so two kind friends (thanks, E. and D.!) applied three coats
of the stuff over a period of a couple of weeks.  It looked great, but
we decided to add an extra coat for better longevity, so we did that
ourselves.

This involved sanding the previous top coat very lightly
with hand-held 220 grit sandpaper, and then applying the PolyWhey with
a 9-inch microfiber pad. It took about one hour for each 150 square
feet of floor, not counting the sanding, which went a bit faster.  The
result is a finish that shows off the beauty of the wood, and is
[just a bit shiny](/gallery/firstday-cottage/IMG_20130513_113750.jpg),
but not thick and glossy like a restaurant table.

Each step we take towards finishing the house makes it feel more like
a home and less like a camping lean-to.  Somehow, for me, the finished
floors seemed to be a bigger step in that direction than usual.

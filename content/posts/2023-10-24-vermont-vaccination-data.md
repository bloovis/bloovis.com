The Vermont Department of Health has published a document
titled
[COVID-19 Vaccine Data](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/lsid-covid-vaccination-data-report.pdf).
It gives data on the "[c]ompleted primary series and updated (bivalent) booster
data as of April 11, 2023".  There are a number of interesting things to note
about this data.

First, we can see that Pfizer makes up the majority of the jabs: 60% in total:

The poor J&J made it into only 3% of Vermonters' arms.  But it probably wasn't safe,
and it was only a one-shot deal -- unlike Pfizer and Moderna, which were totally
safe and effective and required multiple "primary" shots and boosters.

So how many people took the "primary series" of clot shots?  Quite a lot,
showing that we Vermonters were very good about complying with the propaganda:

Even better, people in my age group (65-69) were 100% compliant:

Of course, since I was a bad person and didn't comply, that 100% figure is off by an eensy teensy bit.
(I actually don't know anybody else in that age group who didn't comply.)

We can also see which counties in Vermont complied the hardest and least:

The most compliant counties were the ones with the biggest college towns.  The least compliant county
was Essex, which is also the least populated county, and is probably filled with MAGA hat-wearing
science-denying rednecks.

Despite the fact that Vermont is probably the whitest state in the country,
the Department of Health wanted to be sure that the clot shots were an
equal opportunity poison.  They seem to have succeeded in most counties in getting
blacks to comply even harder than whites:

So all in all, despite the dark cloud on the horizon of poor
compliance with the latest boosters, the Vermont Department of Health
should be congratulated for doing a heckuva job.  Mission accomplished!

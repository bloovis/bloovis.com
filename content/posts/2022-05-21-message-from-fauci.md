Greetings, worshipers of me, The Science™!  It has come to my attention that
some of you are starting to have doubts about The Science™, because it seems
to change so darned often.  But don't worry! The Science™ changes for some very good
reasons, all of which have to do with my maintaining and even increasing
my level of power and control.

The first thing you should know is that despite not ever having treated a patient
in my life, I'm America's Doctor because I know what's best for you, as all good
doctors do.  And what's best for you is, coincidentally, what's best for
Big Pharma.

You see, I've spent my entire career making sure that Big Pharma gets all the
support it can from me and my empire of grifters in academia and government.
Otherwise Big Pharma would have to produce safe, reliable, and inexpensive
products, and that would be a disaster for their profit margins.

So I've been pushing ineffective and even dangerous potions on the
American public for decades.  Not only does Big Pharma benefit from my
generosity and propaganda on their behalf, but I benefit too, in the
form of patent royalties and other perks.  It's a win-win situation
for us!

As I mentioned, I've been practicing this form of deceit for a long time,
so I'm really good at it now.  Take, for example, my big push for AZT
on AIDS patients back in the day.  The stuff was super-toxic and killed
more patients than it saved.  But it was also a super-expensive cash cow
for the company that sold it.  I was able to make it seemed like the
stuff worked by giving blood transfusions every couple of weeks to
the AIDS patients who took it in clinical trials.  Otherwise they would
have died! Clever trick, wasn't it?

Fast forward to 2020 and the Worst Disease Ever.  Yes, I accidentally
told some truth in the years and months leading up the general hysteria,
when I said the following things:

1. Natural immunity is great.
2. Masks don't work.
3. Asymptomatic infection has never been the driver of outbreaks of respiratory viruses.

But I was soon reminded by my buddies at Big Pharma, and by the hysterical
pleas by everybody and their uncle to *do something*, that I had to
change The Science™ ASAP.  So I started lying to people about masks, immunity,
and asymptomatic transmission to get people to not pay attention to that
fact that I had funded the engineering of the Worst Disease Ever.

That's right!  I laundered a bunch of money to the Wuhan Institute of
Virology, through EcoHealth Alliance, so that they could experiment with
creating more virulent forms of SARS.  It worked great, except for the
fact that the virus they created escaped the lab and started infecting
people.  So I needed to deflect attention from my crimes by
recommending useless masks, lockdowns, and anti-social distancing --
and eventually, useless experimental injections.  That way people
could see me as the ultimate representative of super-sciency
scientific Science™, instead of a criminally corrupt and overpaid
bureaucrat.

So stay tuned for more changing Science™!  It's changing so fast, you'll never be able
to keep up with it unless I, the ultimate representative of The Science™,
keep feeding you lies about it.  Also, don't forget to be afraid, and make sure to watch
your TV every day, where you'll be sure to see me regularly.

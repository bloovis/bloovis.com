I thought it would be interesting to compare my income and costs
as a fresh college grad in 1976 with those of today.  Are things
really so much more expensive in Silicon Valley now than they were
way back then?

When I graduated from the University of California in 1976,
[annual tuition](http://www.dailycal.org/2014/12/22/history-uc-tuition-since-1868/)
was $630.  I was able to pay these fees by working a crap summer job
at a warehouse in Redwood City.  In 2012, the annual tuition was $14,460.
So tuition has increased by at least 2295 percent.

My first apartment, near one of the busiest, noisiest intersections in Redwood
City, cost me $160/month.  Now that [same apartment](http://www.149jacksonapts.com/floorplans.aspx)
costs at least $1925/month.  So rents have increased by 1203 percent.

My first job, as a software engineer at a [now-defunct microprocessor manufacturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Semiconductor),
paid around $10,000 per year, if I recall correctly.  Today, the
[starting salary](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-jose-software-engineer-new-grad-salary-SRCH_IL.0,8_IM761_KO9,35.htm)
for a new college grad in Silicon Valley is $128,456 per
year.  (That figure seems high, but let's just assume it's not too
far from reality).  So salaries have increased by 1284 percent.

This tells me that in the last 40 years, salaries for the elites
in Silicon Valley have kept pace with rents.  But tuition has increased nearly
twice as fast.  UC used to be a bargain; now it is a source of long-term debt.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' [CPI Inflation
Calculator](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=100&year1=197609&year2=201802),
the cost of living has increased by about 432 percent in the same period, on
average.  It is clear that Silicon Valley's rents and high-tech
salaries have grown far faster than inflation, which would help to explain
the increasing gentrification throughout the Bay Area and environs.

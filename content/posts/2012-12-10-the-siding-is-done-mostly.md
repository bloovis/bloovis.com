Yesterday we put up the last piece of siding,
ending a six-week slog and a race against winter. We got it done just
in time; last night it snowed a little and now it's raining steadily.
This was a huge milestone, and we can finally relax a little knowing
that the house is weather-proof now.

This step was by far the longest
one in the house construction, and we were pretty tired of it at the
end.  But as with all the stages of this project, we have a great
sense of satisfaction, and it looks pretty good.  We tend to notice
all the minor flaws in our workmanship when we look at the house up
close, but most people would never notice these flaws.

There is still some more work to do on the outside of the house,
mainly trim boards along the eaves and gables, and corner boards,
but that shouldn't take too long, and some of it can wait until next
spring.  Now we're gearing up to do the interior work, and there's
certainly lots of that ahead, but we don't feel the same pressure to
get it done quickly as we did with siding.

Here is a mockup for the corner trim boards:

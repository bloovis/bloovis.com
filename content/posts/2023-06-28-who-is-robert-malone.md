A very good question, that!  Thank you for asking!  Or maybe not... this
question seems to have become a quagmire of muck for the swamp creatures
inhabiting the Medical Freedom Movement, or whatever we are calling
ourselves now.

Nevertheless, I shall attempt to answer this question.  What I'm
about to say is my theory, which belongs to me, which I possess
the ownership of, and it's mine.  Hat tip to Miss Anne Elk:

My theory is specifically about the idea that Robert Malone is "controlled opposition".
Other Substackers have written in detail about this idea, e.g.
[Tereza Coraggio here](https://thirdparadigm.substack.com/p/malone-and-slaughterhouse-four).
Malone may well be malign, but I have a problem with the phrase "controlled opposition":
its vagueness and use of the passive voice.  The article linked to above
enumerates some concrete characteristics of the phrase, which is helpful.

But the question remains: who is the controlling the malign actor, and who is the
malign actor opposing?

Admittedly, I have not delved deeply into this question regarding Robert Malone.
But I have observed that he seems to be an example of an egotistical narcissist.
His actions and words seem to be driven by his need to defend his ego against
all critics, and sometimes his defense is so over the top (the $25M lawsuit)
as to defy all reason.

I realize this is just armchair psychoanalyzing, but look at the obvious things
about Malone:

* He emerged fairly late in the scamdemic, casting himself as a brave whistleblower.
This could be a cover-my-ass move that he chose after realizing that the technology
he helped to create was now being used for malign purposes.  By casting himself
as the brave hero, he could deflect criticism of his role in this invention of mRNA
vaccines.

* He likes to brag about his connections with high-level government spook agencies.
This could be a way to boost his credibility.  "I'm such a great scientist to
have risen so high in the hierarchy!"

* He silences and bans his critics mercilessly on Substack, as if attacking
his ideas is a personal attack.

* He took his approach to critics to the extreme when he sued the Breggins
for $25M.  Apparently, Malone took the Breggins' opposition to Mattias Desmet's
"mass formation" theory (which Malone promoted and mislabeled as "psychosis")
as a personal attack.  See the pattern here? "Attacks on my ideas are attacks
on me as a person!  Whaaah!!!"

* The aforementioned lawsuit had a number of false statements of fact,
as detailed by Diana West [here](https://dianawest.net/Home/tabid/36/EntryId/4648/-Wake-Up-to-Free-Speech.aspx).
This makes the lawsuit seem even more about ego defense and suppression
of criticism and free speech.

* He now whines about how he has no support, despite being wealthy enough
to own a horse farm that caters to the rich, and having thousands of
paid supporters on Substack, and having the verbal support of RFK Jr.
"I'm so lonely, nobody appreciates my heroic stance!   Whaaah!!!"

* People who have met with Malone in person come away believing him to
be honest and trustworthy.  I have some real-life experience with narcissists,
and they can seem very charming and believable at first.  This doesn't
prove that Malone is a narcissist, or at least an egotist, but it is a distinct
possibility.

In short, I don't see Malone as controlled by some shadowy outside agency
or deep state.  He is controlled by his own enormous ego.  His
opponents are everybody who disagrees with him, even if they're
on side of medical freedom and bodily autonomy (which Malone supposedly
supports).

Anyway, that is my theory.  And it's mine, and what it is too.  I
could be entirely wrong, so feel free to disagree!  If you should dare
to express your disagreement, I will sue you for all you're worth
(just kidding!).

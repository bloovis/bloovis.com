I tried installing Linux Mint 18.3 on a ThinkPad T420i yesterday, and ran
into a serious kernel problem that forced me to revert to Mint 18.1.
The problem was a hang that is due to a bug in the driver for
Intel graphics chips (such as that used in the T420i).  The hang
caused the desktop to freeze at random times, sometimes permanently,
requiring reboots using [Alt-SysRq magic keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key).

Occasionally the hang appeared after logging out, and several messages
like the following would appear on the text console:

```
[Wed Mar 21 12:02:00 2018] [drm:drm_atomic_helper_commit_cleanup_done
[drm_kms_helper]] *ERROR* [CRTC:32:pipe A] flip_done timed out
```

There are a number of web pages describing the problem, such as
[this one](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98810).  The
suggestions on some of these web pages, involving adding kernel boot
parameters, did not work for me.  As mentioned above, I chose to
revert back to an installation of Mint 18.1, which uses an earlier
kernel (4.4) that does not have the bug.

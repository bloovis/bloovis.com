Greetings, propaganda believers!  We, the truthy truth-tellers
at the Ministry of Truth, want you proles to know that we've declared
victory in the ongoing war against the Worst Disease Ever.
Mission accomplished and a heckuva job, yay us!  But
now is not the time for complacency.  Keep being afraid!
Here's why:

<!--more-->

As you may have noticed, none of the things we tried to
do to eradicate the Worst Disease Ever actually worked, because
you can't eradicate a respiratory virus that spreads *and*
mutates rapidly.  That's right -- lockdowns, anti-social distancing,
masks, untested experimental injections -- none of it worked.
But we couldn't just sit on our hands and do nothing.  That
would be terrible for our image at the next election cycle,
where we pretend that you have a choice of dictators.  On the contrary!
In response to the world-wide panic and hysteria, we had to be seen as
*doing something*, even if that *something* had no effect other
than to eliminate your inalienable rights.

But we made it look like our useless efforts did *something* through
a clever trick.  Viral epidemics always follow a natural curve of
ups and downs.  So we pretended that any restrictions we instituted
caused the downs (or that any lack of restrictions caused the ups),
and fortunately, you all believed this bullshit.  Victory for
us!

So obviously, the real reason for all of these useless restrictions
and mandates was not to stop the virus, but to get you proles used
to the idea of being fearful and compliant.  This will come in super-handy
in the years to come.  All we have to do to institute ever
more surveillance, restrictions, and control is to invent some
new Scary Thing to scare you with, and you'll roll over and even demand
more restrictions to keep you safe.  It's a two-fer: you get to
pretend to be safe, and we get to pretend that we're keeping you safe.

So don't forget to be afraid.  We've declared victory, but this isn't over yet.
Stay tuned to the Ministry of Truth for further details.

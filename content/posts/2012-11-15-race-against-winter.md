We're now in a race to see if we get all the siding up before real
winter arrives.  We managed to get the most difficult and dangerous
part of it done over two days: putting up the siding over the one story roof.

Now we're continuing past that section and are nearly halfway done
with the whole house.  The weather has been challenging at times; it's
been down in the 20s some mornings, and we've had an occasional
dusting of snow.  But we were fortunate to have a couple of very warm
days this last weekend, so we were able to paint some more siding.

We also scrambled to put together a hearth pad
before the stove itself arrives this coming weekend.

We looked at pre-made
pads, but they were expensive ($600 or more) and didn't quite fit our
floor with its posts along the wall.  We decided to make our own, not
only to save money, but to make something that would fit the actual
orientation of the stove and would look less artificial. This was
another learning process since we'd never done tiling before.  Our
first attempt at mixing mortar wasn't a total success, and it came out
a little too dry.  As a result a few tiles weren't stuck down properly
and had to be pulled up and redone.  The lesson here was to make the
mortar a little bit on the wet side, because it dries as you spread
it.  We did manage to do the grout job successfully.  We'll put a wood
trim border around the whole thing after the stove arrives.

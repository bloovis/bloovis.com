"With the invention of television, and the technical advance which made it
possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument,
private life came to an end.  Every citizen, or at least every citizen
worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the
eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other
channels of communication closed.  The possibility of enforcing not only
complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity
of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time."

-- George Orwell, "Ignorance Is Strength", from *1984*

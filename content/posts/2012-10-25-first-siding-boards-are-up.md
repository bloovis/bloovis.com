After a week and half of part-time work, we now have about 25 feet of
siding boards put up.

The going is pretty slow sometimes because of the difficulty of
cutting the boards to fit around the windows.  After a few mistakes
and a fair amount of fiddling with test boards, we now have a pretty
decent method for doing the difficult bits, but it still takes lots of
measuring and cutting.  At the rate we are going, it will probably
take us a month to get the whole house done.

We stained all the boards before putting them up (thanks so much to
all the helpers who came by for our painting parties!).  We were a
little worried about the color, which was a 50/50 mix of two different
colors (one beige and one cedar).  But it turned out really well, and
the result is a natural looking, slightly reddish color that glows
nicely when the morning sun hits it.  We'll probably add trim around
the edges at some point, stained with a contrasting color (either a
darker brown to match the roof or a forest green).

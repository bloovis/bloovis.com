[George Carlin famously described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuEQixrBKCc) how the
phrase "shell shock", used in WWI, evolved to "battle fatigue" in WWII, then
"operational exhaustion" in the Korean War, then "post traumatic stress disorder"
in the Vietnam War.  In the process,
it gained six syllables and lost all of its power.

I have started to collect some more euphemisms.  This list
will grow over time as I discover new ones.

 Old | New | Extra syllables | Source

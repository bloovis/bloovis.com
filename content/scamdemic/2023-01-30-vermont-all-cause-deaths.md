(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post.)

In an [earlier post](/posts/2023-01-25-vermont-death-data/), I described a procedure
for importing Vermont death certificate data into a MySQL database.
In subsequent posts I looked at [Covid-related deaths](/posts/2023-01-26-vermont-covid-deaths/)
and [cardiac deaths](/posts/2023-01-29-vermont-cardiac-death/).
Now let's look at all-cause deaths, and also at deaths by suicide
and accident.

(Note that the data stop at Oct 26, 2022, and there is a delay between
death and recording, so the drops for October 2022 are not meaningful.)

First, here are all-cause deaths:

There seemed to be a slight increase in deaths in 2020, but a much larger increase
in 2021, for reasons that are baffling to scientists.  Fortunately, the trend
seems to be going back down in 2022.

Now let's look at two types of death that are not listed in the five
cause-related fields in the data.  These are things listed in the "Manner of Death"
field.  The first of these is suicide:

There is no clear trend here, other than a slight increase that started in 2020, with
peaks that are higher than previous years.

Here are deaths by accident:

Here the trend seems more clear.  There seems to be a definite rise in
accident deaths in 2021 that came to a record-breaking peak in the
summer of 2022.  Since then, there has been a sharp downward trend,
which is encouraging, but which could also be due to recording delays.

As I have mentioned before, the reasons for the increases in different types of deaths
starting in 2021 are baffling.  Fortunately, mainstream media have come
up with all sorts of totally plausible explanations:

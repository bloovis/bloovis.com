On one of the evil, no-good, misinformation-dispensing forums on Reddit,
someone asked if mask pushers will ever stop trying to mandate their
use.  The question was raised in response to the LA Public Health department
asking workers and students to start the new year wearing masks for ten days.

My response listed several possible reasons why mask pushers will never
stop.  Here's an expansion of that list.

**False Sense of Security**

Masks give you the feeling that you're "protected" when you venture out into the scary,
virus-filled world.  Of course, masks do nothing of the sort.  This false sense
of security is actually dangerous, because it can lead to people who are truly
vulnerable, such as the aged and frail, putting themselves into risky situations.
("My friends are sick, but I can still visit them because I've got a mask.")

**Pleasurable feeling of civic virtue**

We've been programmed to believe that "my mask protects others".  Therefore,
wearing a mask gives you the heart-warming feeling that you're doing a Good Thing
for your community's health.  The implication
is that if you *don't* wear a mask, you're not interested in protecting others,
so you're a bad person with murderous intent.

**External virtue signal**

It's not enough to feel that warm glow of virtue inside oneself, all
by your lonesome.  It feels even better to show the world that you are
good, caring person, and the mask provides that signal in a highly
visible way.  It's even better than getting an experimental gene
therapy injection, which doesn't show (unless you're one of the
unlucky ones who is visibly harmed by the injection).

**Tell the world to keep being afraid**

By wearing a mask, you're demonstrating that "Covid is not over" and that we all
need to keep being afraid and vigilant.

This particular function of masking sometimes has a downside, though.
Some venues require you to wear a mask if you are sick.  In those
situations, you may want to stay away to avoid being seen as an unclean
plague rat.

**I'm doing something**

We can't bear feeling helpless when faced with something we're told is
the Worst Disease Ever.  So masks make us feel like we're doing
*something*, instead of twiddling our thumbs in abject fear while
waiting to die.

**Mark of compliance**

By wearing a mask, you're demonstrating that you're willing to comply
with edicts issued by unelected government bureaucrats and business
owners.

This implies that those who don't wear masks are the
equivalent of domestic terrorists.  Their non-compliance could
encourage others to distrust government institutions, which would be a
danger to our democracy.

**Last resort**

Nothing else we've tried (lockdowns, distancing, experimental injections)
has worked.  So we fall back on masks in the hope that they will somehow
succeed, even though they, too, have utterly failed.

**Stopping would mean admission of wrong**

If we were to stop wearing masks or mandating them, that would be an implicit
admission that we were mistaken about masks from the very beginning.
It's almost impossible to admit an error when so much investment of time,
money and energy has been invested in the erroneous activity.  This is also known
as the "Sunk Cost Fallacy".

**Can't be soft on safety**

Stopping masks, after advocating for and using them for nearly three years, would
open one up to accusations of being "soft on safety".  This is known as
the Ratcheting Effect, as previously exemplified by the airport security
theater after 9/11.  Security measures like this are almost *never* retracted,
and usually only increase in the future.

The "out" for mask pushers is they they can offer occasional relief
from mandates by citing reduced "cases".  But you can be sure that at
any sign of increased "cases" (which studies show are now positively
correlated with booster shots), the mask mandates will be pushed
again.

For these and other reasons (such as incessant propaganda and gaslighting
dispensed by the mainstream media), the mask situation seems hopeless.
However, the problem could be solved instantly if everybody simply
refused to comply one day.  Whether this will happen is anyone's guess.
For now, it seems that masks aren't going away, especially in medical
settings and government offices.

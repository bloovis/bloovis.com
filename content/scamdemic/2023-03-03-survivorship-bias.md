(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post, except for a tiny bit at the end.)

One good thing about the fake "pandemic" is that I'm learning about the various
ways one can lie with statistics.  Brian Mowrey, the author of the excellent
[Unglossed](https://unglossed.substack.com/), mentioned something called
"survivorship bias" in his article about [stillbirths in Singapore](https://unglossed.substack.com/p/vax-pregnancy-updates-study-review):

Here's a simple "cupcake" example:

Suppose you are a general sending 200 soldiers into battle, and you know
that 10% of them will die each week (probably better odds than trench warfare in
WWI).  After the first week, 20 of the soldiers have
died.  Then you give half of the remaining 180 (i.e., 90) soldiers a cupcake.  A week later,
another 10%, or 18, have died.  Of these 18, 9 had received a cupcake
and 9 of them had been cupcake-deprived.  So in those two weeks, 29 of the soldiers who
had died had *not* received a cupcake, while the remaining 9 who died *had*
received a cupcake.

This proves that cupcakes are a safe and effective way
to prevent death in battle.  In fact, we can calculate the efficacy of cupcakes.

The percentage of un-cupcaked soldiers who died is 29/200, or 14.5%.

The percentage of cupcaked soldiers who died is 9/200, or 4.5%.

The reduction in death rates effected by cupcakes is 14.5%-4.5%, or 10%.

The efficacy of cupcakes is the cupcake-induced reduction in death rates,
divided by the death rate of the un-cupcaked group, 10%/14.5%, or 69%.

This means that in our example, cupcakes are 69% effective against
death in battle!  Not only that, but they are totally safe!  This
should cause the stock price of cupcake makers to go through the roof,
and the DoD should mandate cupcakes for all soldiers.

(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post.)

In the past several months, I have accompanied a friend to several
medical clinics associated with NVRH (Northern Vermont Regional
Hospital) in St. Johnsbury.  These clinics still require the
useless and harmful wearing of masks for all patients and
visitors.  By promoting masks, these medical clinics are, in effect,
the homes of quacks, and, amazingly, the last refuge of maskers.  You'd
think they would be the first to follow their own mantra of "Trust The
Science", but you'd be wrong.  (The mantra is wrong in any case,
because science is not settled orthodoxy written on stone tablets; it is
a method of determining the truth about the world and is always subject
to skepticism, correction, and revision.)

But the mask insanity seems to be slowly dissipating.  Here is some
anecdotal evidence:

A couple of months ago, while walking through the main NVRH hospital on the way
to the billing department, I noticed two unmasked employees, one a nurse in a hallway
and the other a clerk seated at a computer.  I thought to myself, "This is great!
Masks must be optional now."  I was wrong.  A few seconds later, a mask
Nazi, who didn't appear to be a nurse or a doctor, approached me and insisted
several times that I must put on a mask.  I left the building without
complying.

Then a month ago, I spent a couple of hours in the NVRH Internal Medicine building.
In the past, the clerks in the waiting room have insisted on masks, but this time
they didn't.  As my friend and I were led to a conference room to meet with
several doctors, I didn't put on a mask, and was never asked to do so the
entire time I was in the building.  Only one of the six people in the room
wore a mask.  The freedom felt delicious!

Last week my friend and I visited the NVRH Physical Therapy clinic.  Things
were not so friendly there.  While I was standing at the checkin window, the clerk
asked me, "Would you mind putting on a mask?"  I replied, "No, I *would* mind",
and left the building to avoid a confrontation.

Then a few days later, we visited the NVRH Emergency department.  Because we were
going to be there for hours, and I didn't want to abandon my friend, I put
on my "I DO NOT COMPLY" mask but left my nose free, so that I could breath
normally.  During the entire six hours we were in the ER, I was never told
to "fix" my mask.  While we waited in an exam room, we both removed
our masks and when nurses entered, they didn't make us put the masks back on.
During this time, I also noticed that the nurses sometimes took off their
masks when seated at their computers or while talking on phones.  This tells
me that they know masks are worthless, but they must comply with nonsense orders
from above.

We are still very far from having sanity return to medical clinics.  A
year ago things looked entirely hopeless in these settings, but there
are hopeful signs now.

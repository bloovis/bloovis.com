(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post, except for a tiny bit at the end.)

"I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered.
My life is my own."

"Unlike me, many of you have accepted the situation of your imprisonment,
and will die here like rotten cabbages.  Who's standing beside you now?
I intend to discover who are the prisoners, and who are the warders."

The above are quotes from Number 6, the main character played by
Patrick McGoohan in the classic
British TV show from the 1960s, "The Prisoner".  Growing up then, and having
started to read a fair amount of science fiction, I was fascinated by this show.
Watching it now (it's available on Kanopy, a streaming service
that our library subscribes to), it seems to be ever more relevant and prescient.

"The Prisoner" depicts a beautiful, comfortable prison called The
Village, where ex-intelligence dissenters and whistle-blowers are
confined for life.  All prisoners are known by numbers, not by names.
They are watched and tracked by surveillance systems at all times and
cannot escape.  Their day-to-day life is a simulacrum of real life,
where prisoners are encouraged to indulge in hobbies, participate in a
phony "democracy", snitch on each other, refer to each other with
dehumanizing numbers, and comply with strident and often brutal demands
for more and more information.

Each episode in the series started with a lengthy sequence that
recaps the first part of the first episode, in which a new Number 2,
the chief warden, is introduced (the identity of Number 1 is not revealed):

Of course, this show is only fantasy.  We would never allow ourselves
to create a society where freedom is highly restricted, where all our movements
are watched over by machines of loving grace, where we are pressured into group-think
and compliance at all times, where all information about ourselves is gathered
by our prison wardens, where we don't even know whose side our prison wardens are
on, where "democracy" is clearly fake, and where we practice dehumanizing rituals
on each other.  Such a thing would be inconceivable!

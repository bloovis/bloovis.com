Greetings, agoraphobics! Remember how great lockdowns were back in 2020?
Well, we at the Ministry of Truth want you to know that they weren't so great,
actually, because they didn't do squat for stopping the Worst Disease Ever.  But
there's a simple reason why they didn't work, and you'll never guess what
it is.  Well, OK, here it is:

<!--more-->

The answer is that we didn't lock down *hard* enough, or *early* enough, or *long* enough.
We should have taken a hint from the virtuous and super-sciency scientific Chinese,
who welded people's doors shut so they could enjoy lockdowns even more.  We
were too lax, and didn't do enough last time.  But don't worry.  Dr. Fauci
warned that we might have more restrictions in the future, and we'll be sure
to do lockdowns harder, longer, and faster next time.  It makes us excited
just thinking about it!

Once again, we can take a lesson from the Chinese.  The latest lockdowns
in Shanghai are totally great, because nine million people are being kept safe from
the Worst Disease Ever.  OK, sure, some people are committing suicide, and some
are dying because they can't get to hospitals, and some are dying of starvation.
But that's OK, because a death from the Worst Disease Ever is the only death
that counts.  Even if a thousand people die from being locked down, it's totally
worth it if it saves just one death from the Worst Disease Ever.  Besides, all
those other deaths mean fewer people complaining about the lockdowns.

What's even better about the new harder and longer lockdown in China is that
pets are being killed to save people from the Worst Disease Ever. This is
totally great, too, because we want people to be lonely and isolated and depressed,
and pets can distract people from their misery.

So buckle up, citizens of the Land of the Free!  The next lockdown is going
to be pretty darned wonderful, and you should be asking the lying, corrupt
people who run your state government to do something bold for your safety
from the Worst Disease Ever.

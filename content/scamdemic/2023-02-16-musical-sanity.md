(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post.)

For a while now I've been whining about two classical music organizations here in Vermont
that implemented jab mandates.  The first was the
[Rochester Chamber Music Series](https://rcmsvt.org/), right here in my adopted
hometown. The second was the [Sonata Piano Camp](https://www.sonatina.com/),
in Bennington (about a two hour drive south of here).  Both of these organizations
have have taken a lot of my money in the past, but apparently they
don't want my money any more because I'm an unclean plague rat.

But all is not lost here in Virtuous Vermont.  There is a chamber
series in St. Johnsbury (almost a two hour drive north of here) that
has not succumbed to the madness.  It's called the
[Northeast Kingdom Classical Series](https://www.nekclassicalseries.org/), and it's
pretty darned wonderful.  There are no jab and mask mandates, and the
music is great.  I have attended two concerts so far, and they were
amazing and thrilling.  It's a long drive, but completely worth
it.  Vermonters looking for a combination of good music and sanity
should support this series.

My general impression of the so-called "Northeast Kingdom", the upper
right corner of Vermont, is that it is more sane and
down-to-earth than the more urban or flatlander-infested areas of
Vermont.  (I'm technically a flatlander myself, but I reject the
flatlander ethos, which involves bringing everything to Vermont that I
tried to escape: bright lights, strip malls, fear-driven do-good-ism,
etc.) Not only is the music series in St. Johnsbury pleasant, but the
[beautiful library](https://www.stjathenaeum.org/)
there is also a pleasant place that is free of mask
mandates.  So I'm seriously
thinking of moving up the NEK to escape from the insanity in the rest of
Vermont that, so far, has shown no signs of dying out.  If the
insanity continues this summer, then I'll know for sure that I really
don't belong in this town any more.

Greetings, pfearful pfaithful!  As you know, we at the Ministry of Truthiness
want you to avoid information that could contradict our relentless propaganda.
So in this message we're providing you with a list of web sites that you
absolutely, definitely *must* avoid if you want to (1) keep yourselves afraid
of the Worst Disease Ever, and (2) continue to comply with all of
our useless rules and mandates.

Remember: the following are sites that you *must* avoid at all costs.  Don't
click on on any of these links!  They are all no-good, terrible, bad, awful,
anti-science, racist, and misogynistic sources of misinformation!

Greetings, pFizer pFaithful!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness want
you to guard against misinformation about reality that contradicts our
own version of reality, otherwise known as The Scienceâ„¢.  What should
you do when evil right-wing conspiracy-theorizing domestic
terrorist nutcases say Bad Things about our response to the Worst
Disease Ever or the Glorious Goo or face diapers, and try to show you studies
proving their point?  Here are some useful strategies:

**Cover Your Ears**

Don't engage!  Don't listen!  Don't read any
of that terrible misinformation!  Instead, say that you've done a lot
of research (i.e., listened to NPR every morning) and you know
that everything these nutcases say is wrong.  Simple!

**Fight Back**

Call the nutcases bad names!  Call them Covid-denying anti-science selfish
murdering extremist granny killers.  That should teach them a lesson and make you
feel more virtuous.

**Appeal to Authority**

Tell the nutcases that since they're not doctors, they shouldn't have an opinion
on medical matters.  Instead, say that you trust only experts, like
Dr. Fauci, or Joe Biden, or Rachel Maddow, or Bill Gates, or Justin Trudeau.
It doesn't matter that these experts got The Worst Disease Ever despite having injected
the Glorious Goo. The point is that these experts are more famous
and wealthy than you or your nutcase enemies, and thus should be
trusted.

**Ostracize and Shame**

If the nutcases peddling misinformation are friends or family members, don't
let them hug you or even be in the same room with you, because they are
obviously unclean plague rats who want to kill you.

**Fire Them**

If the nutcases are your employees, you should fire them
so that they will retreat to their homes and lock themselves away from society.
If Noam Chomsky has his way, they'll starve to death in self-imposed
isolation.  Good riddance!

**Censor Them**

If these nutcases do any writing on social media, make sure that you get
them cancelled, deleted, banned -- censored, in other words.  That way
their dangerous misinformation won't be a threat to our democracy any more.
Remember, democracy requires total obedience and agreement.

**Dismiss the Source**

When the nutcases show you statistics from [VAERS](https://openvaers.com/covid-data)
(the CDC's and FDA's own data), say that VAERS can't be trusted, even though
you trust everything else the CDC and FDA tell you.  Similarly, when the nutcases
show you web pages with huge lists of studies about the Glorious Goo or face diapers,
say that you don't know who created those lists, freeing you from the hassle
of actually having to look at those studies.  In other words, if the information
doesn't come from approved government spokescreatures, it doesn't count.

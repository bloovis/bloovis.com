(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post.)

A couple of weeks ago I reported about my [experiences dealing with mask mandates](/posts/2023-04-04-mask-quacks/)
in medical clinics associated with Northern Vermont Regional Hospital.  Back then,
the various buildings in that conglomerate required masks, but had varying
levels of enforcement.

I was pleased to discover three days ago that the mask mandates have been dropped
at this fine institution of allopathic medicine, though of course there
are still signs on all the entry doors encouraging the use of the ineffectual
and harmful face diapers.

I also discovered last week that the dental office in Massachusetts that
I visit regularly no longer requires masks.  Over the last
two years, the dentist and technician there that have treated me have privately agreed with me about
the foolishness of masks and experimental injections, and never made me wear
a mask outside of the waiting room.  But they were forced to
require masks in the waiting room due to nonsensical "rules" enforced by
the state "health" bureaucracies.  Thankfully, those "rules" appear to have
been dropped.

I'm not sure what led to the dropping of mask requirements by the quacks -- I mean
*experts* -- staffing the state "health" bureaucracies.  Maybe it was our intellectual
giant of a president, Joe Biden, signing off on the idea that the scamedemic
is over.  Or maybe the great, beautiful vaccines invented by that prior intellectual
giant of a president, Donald Trump, are finally turning out to be effective (if not safe)
after two plus years.

I seriously doubt that last bit about efficacy, though.  When I was
visiting a friend who acts as an interface between me and the world
of the normal Covid faithful, I discovered that people in this normie
world, despite being jabbed, are still coming down with that Dreaded Plague -- two more just
this last week.  Of course, they and all their friends are testing like crazy because, for
some reason, this disease is so horribly deadly, despite the safe and effective
jabs, that we must pay
constant attention to it, and fear and test for it at all times, even after three
years of insane amounts of fear and testing and jabs.  We never tested
constantly and quaked in our boots 24 hours a day during past flu
seasons, but This Time It's Different, apparently.

So in conclusion, there are more rays of hope, but it's obvious that the society-wide
damage to mental health has still not healed, and I fear it may not be healed
in my lifetime (i.e. in the next couple of decades, if I'm lucky).

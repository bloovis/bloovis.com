Coquin de Chien (John Paul Beaudoin, Sr.) has written a
[very informative and useful article](https://coquindechien.substack.com/p/suddenly-and-unexpectedly)
about the occurrences of the words "suddenly" and "unexpectedly"
in obituaries in the United States.  Please read the article
for the details and the alarming graphs, but the idea is
that you can use Legacy.com's [obituary search engine](https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/search)
to see how often these terms were used for particular date ranges
and regions.  The article shows graphs for the United States
as a whole, and for several states individually.  All of them show
huge increases in the occurrence of "suddenly" and "unexpectedly"
in obituaries in 2021.  Of course, the very sciency scientific
scientists are completely baffled about the cause, but it's probably
climate change or too many naps or something.

Here are the results for my home state of Vermont.  As with all
the other states, the trend is unmistakable.  Note that the results
for 2023 are just for the period up to today (Aug 28), so undoubtedly
the total will be significantly larger by the end of the year.

(Sarcasm is *OFF* for this post.)

[Update: Here are two articles that articulate my position much more clearly and thoroughly:

Toby Rogers: [Mapping the different theories of the case in the medical freedom movement](https://tobyrogers.substack.com/p/mapping-the-different-theories-of)

Hugh Willbourn: [Cock-up, Conspiracy or Murmuration?](https://www.hughwillbourn.com/post/23-cock-up-conspiracy-or-murmuration)]

Many of us who have resisted the Covid insanity for the last three years
have been struggling with the question of responsibility: who is responsible
for this insanity?  Answering this question could be helpful in ensuring
that this insanity doesn't happen again.

But the question has led to a discouraging amount of in-fighting in the
anti-insanity movement.  One the one hand, we have people who point
to specific people as the villains in this story, such as:

* Bill Gates
* George Soros
* Anthony Fauci
* Klaus Schwab

The idea here is that if we can remove these people from power, perhaps using
the criminal justice system, the result will be unicorns and rainbows.

Then there are critics like C. J. Hopkins (whose book *The New Normal Reich*
I highly recommend), who argue that the villain is global capitalism
(which Hopkins calls "GloboCap").  This faceless, apolitical monstrosity has no ideology
other than "reality", a reality it creates in order to subject the world
to its control.

Then there is the idea of "mass formation", as articulated by Mattias
Desmet (whose book *The Psychology of Totalitarianism* I highly
recommend), in which the terrorized and atomized populace demands that
governments keep them "safe" with anti-freedom rules and regulation.

Then there are factions that have uncovered evidence that the insanity
was coordinated by the US government, which created and deliberately
released the super-scary virus, and simultaneously created the unsafe
and ineffective magical cure.

These various factions hate -- or at least distrust -- each other.  For example, the GloboCap proponents
hate the Mass Formation proponents for supposedly blaming the populace
for the insanity, and have written numerous articles explaining why
they're right and Desmet is wrong.  The in-fighting reminds me of
Tom Lehrer's song "National Brotherhood Week", in which everybody
hates everybody else, despite the urging to treat each other
as brothers and sisters:

But despite my apparent cynicism here, I think it's actually a good thing
that these various factions are working hard on their theories.  I believe
that the Covid insanity is much too large and complicated to be fully
and easily understood (I'm reminded of the parable of blind men trying
to understand an elephant).  The various pieces that these factions
are investigating are important parts of the insanity as a whole,
and are worth uncovering, but no one piece is the entire story.

So for example, I believe that both mass formation *and* GloboCap
are real and reinforce each other.  GloboCap succeeded in scaring
people into a mass panic, and the people in turn demanded that
GloboCap *do something* to make them feel safe.  And it seems
likely that GloboCap utilized government agencies like the
Department of Defense to further its goals.  There are many
more interconnections like these; the story is not as simple
as we'd like it to be.

Back in early September, I went hiking in the early morning at a nearby
state park.  There were no other cars at the trailhead when I started out.
Just before I returned to the car an hour and half later, I encountered
two young women hiking up the trail towards me.
They freaked out a little and scurried over to the side of the trail.
One of them quickly put on a mask, and the other pulled her shirt up over
her face.  They apologized as I walk by.

This is what the all-pervasive narrative about fear of the unknown has
done to us.  Even in a safe situation, miles from civilization, in the
outdoors, people are so consumed by fear that they engage in irrational,
mindless behavior.

Other examples I've seen in the last few days:

* People wearing masks while driving alone in their own cars

* People wearing masks while walking down streets in town far from any other person

* A man so panicked by my entering the post office just ahead of him that he refused
to come inside at first, even though we were both wearing masks.  I had to plead with
him to enter and not stand outside in the cold.

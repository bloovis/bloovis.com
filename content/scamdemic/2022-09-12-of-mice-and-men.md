Greetings, pfaithful jabbers!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness
are sure you'll be excited to know about our new boosters -- oops,
we mean *updates* -- of the Glorious Goo.  They're two Goos in one:
one for the original Worst Disease Ever, and one for the Omigod scariant
of the Worst Disease Ever.  OK, sure, the original WDE isn't around any more,
and the Omigod WDE isn't actually very scary.  But that doesn't matter.
We want to make sure that you continue to be obedient, and injecting
yourself with the updated Goo is the best way you can signal your obedience.

But how about safety?  OK, sure, the previous Glorious Goos were
actually harmful, but you can ignore all that
[pesky safety data](https://openvaers.com/covid-data) because,
as we've said a million times before, the Goo is safe.  Besides, we
tested the new Goo on a dozen mice, and they didn't keel over
right away.  And mice are kinda like humans, right?  So we didn't
bother testing the New and Improved Goo on humans.

But how about efficacy?  OK, sure, the previous Glorious Goos didn't
stop transmission or infection, so everybody and their uncle
(including our Fearless Leader Brandon and Saint Anthony Fauci)
got the Worst Disease Ever, despite having gotten four doses of the Goo.
But it would have been much worse without the Goo!  So as we've said
*ad infinitum*, the Goo is not only safe, but it's effective too.

So Trust the Scienceâ„¢ and be sure to inject the new Double-Good Goo
ASAP.  After all, you don't want to be thought of as some kind
of extremist granny-killer, do you?

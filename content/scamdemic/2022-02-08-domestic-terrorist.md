The Department of Homeland Security's
[National Terrorism Advisory System](https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-february-07-2022)
wants you to know that you are a domestic terrorist if
you are responsible for "the proliferation of false or misleading narratives,
which sow discord or undermine public trust in U.S. government institutions."

Naturally, the government is completely trustworthy, and always has been.
Furthermore, the government's narrative is the one true one, and all
other narratives are false or misleading.

Do not question this.  Do not think for yourself.  Closed minds stop
thought crimes!

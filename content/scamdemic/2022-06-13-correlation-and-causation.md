Greetings, lovers of The Science™!  We at the Ministry of Truthiness want
you to understand how The Science™ changes depending on whether
it contradicts our propaganda or not.  Our example for today
is a statement you may have heard before: correlation is *not* causation.
We'll show you how you can use it against those doubleplus-ungood conspiracy-theorist
granny killers who aren't obeying our diktats, while at the same time
using its negation to prove that all our lies are actually truthy and truthful
nuggets of truthiness.

You've probably run into some deplorables who point out that some people
have died soon after being injected with our Glorious Goo.  All you have
to do to prove these people wrong is to say that correlation is *not*
causation, in this particular instance.  The people who died must certainly have
died because of something else.  Here's a partial list of those possible
causes that are definitely *not* the Glorious Goo:

* climate change
* cold weather
* hot weather
* traffic noise
* too much freedom
* high energy bills
* snow shoveling
* Sudden Adult Death Syndrome
* not enough boosters
* a new scariant
* not enough masking

See?  That's huge list of reasons why those people died after taking the 
Glorious Goo, versus only one silly reason mentioned by those no-goodniks.

Now, here's an instance where correlation *is* causation.  We like to
say that lockdowns prevented the Worst Disease Ever from getting even
worse, by showing you graphs of "cases" of the Worst Disease
Ever over time.  Of course, you may have noticed that "cases" sometimes rose sharply
after we started lockdowns, before dropping again, but that's because
it took a while for lockdowns to have their effect.  Also, some
disobedient people broke the rules, and that slowed down our efforts.
But the main point to remember is that in this case, declines in
"cases" happened at some point after lockdowns started.  Therefore,
lockdowns *must* have caused the decline!  See how that makes total
sense?  It means that you don't have to consider any other
possibilities, like seasonal rises and falls that have been happening
for millennia with respiratory viruses.  Ignore all that history and
just know that this time, it's different, due to our super-sciency
scientific Science™.

In summary, just remember that correlation *is* causation when something agrees
with our truthy lies, and is *not* causation when something disagrees with our
truthy lies.

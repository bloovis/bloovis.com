Greetings from the Medical Propaganda division of the Ministry of Truthiness,
otherwise known as the CDC!  Recently we've been forced to admit that we lied
when we said the Glorious Goo could stop the Worst Disease Ever, like
conspiracy theorists were saying we were lying about a year ago.  But that doesn't mean The
Science™ was wrong -- far from it!  It just means we couldn't have known
we were lying, and The Science™ has changed.  So we're going
make sure that doesn't happen again.  Here's how:

<!--more-->

Before we get started, we want to assure you that just because we
agree with those pesky conspiracy theorists who said the Glorious Goo
couldn't stop the Worst Disease Ever, it doesn't mean that *we* are
conspiracy theorists.  When we say something, it's automatically true,
but when somebody we don't like says something, it's a
conspiracy theory.  You see, it's all a matter of timing: we can't let
people tell the truth before we do.

Now, on to our plan for rebuilding our credibility.  We can't let inconvenient
facts get in our way again, so we're going to make sure we have even
better control of the facts.  We're going to make sure other government
agencies and state governments pay better attention to us and obey our
diktats at all times.  No more pesky states like Florida ignoring us!

Then we're going to make sure our Fearless Leader has more direct control
over our research departments.  That way she can really make sure they
come up with The Science™ that agrees not with reality, but with our
agenda for total control of the population.

With these and other measures, we're going to eliminate any remaining
pockets of factual dissent.  That way we can Build Back Better at the
CDC, in accordance with the philosophy of our spiritual adviser, Der
Schwabenklaus.  If all goes well, we'll never again have to admit we were
wrong, and you'll never again be unsure of our authority about
The Science™.

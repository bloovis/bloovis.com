I'm going to promote another book today:
[The Rise of the New Normal Reich](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3982146429/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4),
by C. J. Hopkins.  Please order the book now, but note that it has been banned
by Amazon in Germany, Austria, and The Netherlands.  It's all the more
urgent to buy this book now, because Hopkins, who lives in Germany,
is now under [criminal investigation in Berlin](https://cjhopkins.substack.com/p/political-satirist-ie-me-under-criminal).

Hopkins' supposed crime was tweeting the cover of his excellent book, which features a surgical
mask overlaid faintly by a Nazi swastika.  I have a copy of this book, and
it is a fierce denunciation of fascism and totalitarianism in all of its forms.
Apparently the Berlin State Prosecutor has *not* read the book, and hence does not appreciate
the irony that this prosecution proves the point of the book.

Fortunately, Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, who was also subject to a similar criminal charge
in Germany, was [acquitted](https://margaretannaalice.substack.com/p/profiles-in-courage-prof-dr-sucharit).
So there's hope.

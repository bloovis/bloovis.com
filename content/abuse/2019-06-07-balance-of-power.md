This post is about something that is only indirectly related to verbal abuse:
the balance of power in relationships, and balance in general, and my experience
of these things in my current relationship.

First, I want to mention an idea that I haven't read about elsewhere, but
which occurred to me a year or two ago.  What I've observed most clearly
in this relationship, but also to a lesser extent in past relationships,
is that the person with the most strongly felt and expressed preferences
usually gets their say in decisions.

These decisions can be about minor things (such as what we listen to
on the radio) or major things (such as planning for a backpack trip).
I tend to not express strong preferences in order to avoid rocking the
boat.  So when my partner expresses very strong opinions about these
thing, or gets upset or angry when I express different opinions, I
back off and say, "Sure, OK, fine".  But my weakness leads me to feel
resentment later about having to along with the other person's
preferences.  I would like to be more assertive about expressing my
own wishes, but I fear the possible negative consequences. 

To return to the two examples I mentioned: a minor one is radio or
music listening preferences.  When I've tried putting on some of my
favorite music on the stereo, she usually objects in some way (the
music is too violent, too boring, too something).  She's complained
about nearly everything I've tried: from the piano quartets of Brahms, to
the somewhat mainstream local classical music radio station, to the
rather mellow and folk-tinged "Entangled" by Genesis.  (I have
recently discovered that Debussy Preludes played at a very low volume
seem to be acceptable.) The end result is that when we listen to the
stereo or car radio, it's mostly her preference, usually a news station
that I can barely stand at the best of times.

I mentioned in passing the major example, planning for a backpack trip, in my
post about the [book-throwing
incident](/abuse/2019-05-31-book-throwing-incident/).  The conflict
about this kind of planning goes back to the very early days of our
relationship.  Back then I was ecstatic to have found a partner who
shared my love of hiking, but almost immediately I found that my ideas
about backpacking, and particularly the use of modern ultralight
equipment, were not acceptable.  When I brought up these ideas, in
particular the use of sil-nylon tarps instead of much heavier tents,
she became very angry at me for what she thought was my dismissal of
her much greater experience.  I tried gently to suggest that perhaps
newer technology was better than what she'd tried 30 years before, but
that just brought on a new bout of angry accusations.

This angry outburst was my first hint that something was not quite
right about this relationship.  But I ignored the warning signs and
decided that it was best to not talk about my own experience if it
contradicted hers in any way.  To be fair, she did eventually come
around to trying out my ideas, after five years of using her heavy,
leaky, and stuffy tents.  This seems like a rather long time to wait
for my ideas to be taken seriously.  I'm even less willing nowadays to
champion my own ideas, given that the verbal abuse outbursts have
gotten worse over the years.  Essentially, I've surrendered most of my
power in this relationship.

I'll write more about balance in a later post.

Eleven months ago I received a bout of verbal abuse that, for the first time, bordered on physical abuse.
It shocked me into writing my experience down soon afterward so that I could try
to make sense of it.  What follows is what I wrote then, verbatim, with no additions
or edits, so some of it may seem a bit repetitive or poorly organized.

Here's what I wrote to my distant friend T. about this the day after it happened:

> It got worse last night.  She got so angry with me for being a "terrible fucking listener"
> that she started pulling books from my bookshelves in the piano room and throwing them
> on the floor and kicking them.  She also did this to the music books I had on the piano
> and some of my fine art photography books.  When I protested, she said something like, "This is what
> I have to do to get your attention", and, "You care more about your books than you do about me."
> When I said she didn't need to violent to get my attention, she stood over me, shaking
> her fists at my face, saying, "You wanna see violent?"
> 
> I recognize that she's acting like her mother did to her, and I said so, and that got
> me another dose of anger.
> 
> She then told how unhappy she was that I was hogging all the bookshelves in the piano
> room.
> 
> I also talked about how I was thinking of seeing a counselor, and I got the expected
> disdain and criticism for that ("You only think about your own needs", and "more money
> spent", and "more scheduling interfering with our plans").
> 
> She also turned up the stereo so loud I could barely hear her, and said, "This is
> what it looks like when I don't take your feelings into account".  This was a response
> to something I said early on that caused so much outrage: that I didn't feel
> that she took my ideas seriously.
> 
> When I took my pillow and said I was going to sleep in the old house because of the noise,
> she accused me of running away and avoiding talking.  I tried to explain that I didn't
> want to talk if we were just going in circles and yelling (she did pretty much
> all of the yelling but denied it, saying "I'm just raising my voice").
> 
> So I sucked it up and slept in our shared bed last night, to prove
> that I wasn't running away.  I got maybe five hours of sleep.  When I

> the floor, plus the few remaining paperbacks, then went out to do my
> morning garden chore, which is to water the eggplants, peppers, and
> melons in the two greenhouses.  This takes almost an hour.  When I got
> back she said that she saw my packed books and that this was the first
> step towards my leaving.  There is probably some truth to, but mostly
> I did it to protect the books from further damage, and to free up the
> shelves so that she could use them.  I gave her this last reason but
> she dismissed it, saying, that she felt I was guarding those shelves,
> that I kept putting her books on the shelves next to her desk, that
> these were supposed to be shared shelves, etc.
> 
> I really don't feel safe any more.  I thought she was going to take a hammer

> day in December 2016 when I had called from the library saying I wasn't coming

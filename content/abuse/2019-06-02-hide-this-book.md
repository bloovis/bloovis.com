When I started reading about verbal abuse a year ago, I started with a hardback
copy of Robin Stern's *The Gaslight Effect* that I checked out of our local library.
I disguised the book under a plain paper cover, only read it when I was alone,
and hid it in my desk when I was not reading it.  I was pretty sure that my abuser
would become very angry and possibly abusive again if she saw me reading the book.
I based this judgment on what she'd told me earlier when I mistakenly brought up
the topic of verbal abuse in one of our "discussions".

After that, I only read books on the subject that I could download electronically.
Even then, I made sure that I never left the books open on my ebook device when I
wasn't using it.

I feel a little twinge of guilt about all this hiding, but I'm terrified of
being the target of another angry outburst.

Today I happened to mention to my wife something similar that I did
in my first marriage many years ago.  My then-wife, who was non-religious
when we married, became a fundamentalist Catholic, and was terribly
disappointed that I couldn't follow her in this path.  I tried to attend
church and bible study, but I couldn't shake my life-long agnostic skepticism,
and I eventually stopped trying to be religious.

During this period I read
two books that gave me the confidence to leave religion behind: *Why I Am Not
a Christian*, by Bertrand Russell, and *The Mythmaker*, by Hyam Maccoby.
(The latter book, I understand now, was based on shaky scholarship, but
it was convincing to me at the time, and I don't think that recent scholarship
would change my beliefs.)

I kept these books hidden from my then-wife, out of fear of her
reaction, and to avoid hurting her.  In retrospect, this was arguably
a cowardly act.

When I mentioned this book-hiding to my current wife
during a conversation today, she told me that she hoped I would never
do something like that to her, and that doing so would be a marriage
deal-breaker (not her exact words, but that's the essence of it).

So now I have a new batch of guilt to experience.  It's the gift that
keeps on giving, apparently.

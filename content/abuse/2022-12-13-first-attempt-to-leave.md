It's been just over two years since I wrote the last post here.
I noticed that in my post about [visitors](/abuse/2019-08-24-visitors/),
I promised to write about how I tried and failed to leave the
marriage for a 30-day separation.  Here is what happened then:

By the middle of December, 2016, my wife had spent several months
being annoyed and angry with me, in what I had come to call her
"hyper-critical mode".  In desperation, I decided that I needed
to leave home and stay away for 30 days, to give me the time
and space to decide what to do for the long term.  But
I didn't plan my escape very well.

One evening, when I was working late at the library where I volunteer,
I called a nearby rooming house to verify that a room was available
that night.  Then I called my wife and told her I wasn't coming
home and that I needed a 30 day break.  I had no extra clothes
or other supplies with me, but I was desperately unhappy and
hadn't thought through my plans.

After a two-hour, emotionally stressful
conversation with my wife, she threated to kill herself, so
I went back home.

It took me another three years to finally get up the courage to leave
again, which I managed to do on January 7, 2020.  This time I
planned things well in advance, and was able to escape with most
of my belongings and without interference.  I will write more
about this great escape in another post.

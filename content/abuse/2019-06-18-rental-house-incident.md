After my partner and I built a house together and I retired from 
my full-time job, I no longer needed the house I had bought when
I first moved to this area.  We decided it would be easier to
rent that second house than to sell it in a very slow market, so I reluctantly
found myself being a landlord.  My handling of the communications
with our future renter brought on an angry blast of verbal abuse from my partner,
along with a vindictive punishment.  This two-for-one pattern was starting 
to feel familiar by now.

The familiar pattern was this: my partner would ask me to take on a task of significant
responsibility, but would then micro-manage my handling of the task and criticize
it at every step of the way.  Eventually, her anger and distrust would explode
into an abusive outburst, followed by some sort of punishment.

In the case of rental house, she became very angry at me for communicating
via email with the future renter *without* first running each email by her
for her approval.  I had started doing this at first, but quickly discovered
that she never liked anything I was writing and would completely rewrite
each email to her satisfaction.  In other words, she wanted me to have
all of the responsibility (and blame) for handling the rental house, but
none of the control.  This was an impossible situation for me, besides
being very frustrating and slow.

Eventually (and mistakenly) I start communicating with the renter without
getting my messages pre-approved, and when my partner discovered this,
she exploded with the angry outburst, and punished me by dropping her promise to help
me with the cleanup and preparation of the house for the soon-to-arrive
renter.

The result was that I had to spend a week of full days in the middle
of winter cleaning the house and moving all of the furniture to the
basement myself.  If you've ever tried to move a couch down a flight
of stairs without help, you will know how difficult this can be.

As I had come to expect, this punishment was followed by a month or more
of the "hypercritical mode", where I could do nothing right.

I had already seen this pattern during the building of our house, so while
it was shocking and deeply hurtful, it was also familiar.  I'll write more
about the house-building incident at another time.

One of the put-downs that I receive the most is: "You're being defensive!"
I have struggled for years with this one, because I keep thinking there must
be some truth to it, and because my wife keeps telling me I have to change.

Yes, it's possibly true that I am more sensitive to criticism than the
average person.  But then I start to think about the circumstances
surrounding the incidents where I find myself reacting defensively,
and doubt creeps in.  In particular, in my previous relationships I
never experienced this level and frequency of criticisms, corrections,
and "advice".  In the early years of this current relationship, I used
to think of my partner's ugly moods as her "hypercritical mode" (I
never mentioned this term aloud).  These were periods, sometimes
lasting as long as months, when I never seemed to do anything right
and would be corrected or criticised or subjected to angry outbursts
many times a day.  So I would react with defensiveness because I felt
unappreciated and unfairly treated.

I am now willing to believe that maybe it's not reasonable for me to
be criticized to this degree.  I readily admit I'm not the perfect
partner, but I also think I deserve some more tolerance and
understanding for my mistakes and goofs, and less "advice" and angry
outbursts when I fail at perfection.

Now that I'm a little less confused about this situation, I'm working
hard at trying not to be defensive when the verbal abuse comes my way.
It seems that the best defense is to not respond at all.  Occasionally
I slip up and react, and nothing good ever comes from that.

I once asked my wife to do what my piano teachers have done, which is to
soften the criticism or correction by preceding it with a mention of
the things that I *have* done correctly.  She rejected this idea,
saying it felt "artificial".  So I have given up hope that I can expect
any better treatment.  To be fair, I should mention that she does treat me better
and sometimes even praise me when she's feeling happy and satisfied
with my actions, but this is usually only a brief period of calm
in the cycle of abuse (more about that in another post).

Switch the gender around in the quote above, and it certainly
applies to me, and I don't believe I'm alone in this.

When I think back on this relationship, I think it may not be
coincidence that my loss of interest in sex started around the same
time that the verbal abuse started getting quite serious: that is,
when shocking, angry outbursts were followed by month-long periods
of "hypercritical mode" when I could do nothing right.

What makes this worse is that when I hear her comments about sex, and the lack of it,
I feel plenty of shame about it.  I am not blaming my partner for *making me feel*
shame.  I think what is happening is that the unkind comments trigger some
of my deep-seated feelings of inadequacy about sex that precede this relationship.
(This is a long story that I might write about another time.)

I don't see a solution to this problem.  I don't think I can have sexual
feelings for somebody who hurts me regularly by saying terrible things about me,
and I don't see that situation changing in the long term.

As an aside, I have a friend who is celibate by choice, because she
feels that for her, sexual relationships are a dead end.  She is
probably the most physically affectionate and loving person I have
ever met, so clearly her path works for her.  (She also lives a day's
drive away, and I have not seen her in ten years, and I miss her
terribly.) I have often thought that perhaps her path would
also work well for me.

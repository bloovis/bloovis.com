I understand that my partner's abuse of me is a continuation of the abuse
she suffered as a child.  Her mother was physically and verbally abusive
on a daily basis, and her brothers beat her up regularly and teased her
mercilessly.

She has made huge strides in overcoming the trauma she experienced
from this abuse.  But she doesn't seem to recognize that she is using
some of her mother's tactics on me.  I brought this up in one "conversation",
and she denied that her yelling and book-throwing and cursing had any relation
to her mother's abuse.  Instead, she said she was simply verbalizing her
anger and accused me of trying to suppress her expressions of her feelings.

The result is that I now know it's very unlikely that I will
be able to explain to her how her abuse of me is hurtful.  I understand
more about how her pain and suffering has affected her, and how it is now
being inflicted on me.  But that doesn't excuse the abuse.  It simply
allows me to feel more compassionate and less angry about the abuse.

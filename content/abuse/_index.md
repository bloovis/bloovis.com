This subsection contains posts I wrote as a secret blog
during the period when I was dealing with verbal abuse
in my marriage.  I had to keep it secret in order to
avoid endangering myself and my escape plan.  The
marriage ended in 2024, so I feel it's safe to
publish these posts now, in case they might
help someone else dealing with abuse in a relationship.

A good place to start would be [The Book-Throwing Incident](/abuse/2019-05-31-book-throwing-incident/).

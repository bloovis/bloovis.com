My partner and I both get impatient with each other at times.
I was guilty of this today when I was trying to explain to
her how I had just managed to free a skunk from a Havahart trap
without getting sprayed.  She didn't understand my explanation,
and kept asking questions, and I made a huge mistake that I instantly
regretted: expressing impatience with a sigh.

Understandably, this upset her.  She said that she needs to ask
questions when something doesn't make sense, and that I get impatient
with her *a lot*.  I apologized immediately, said that I wanted to
hear her questions, and offered to fetch a smaller trap that I could
use to make my explanation clearer.  She refused to accept this offer,
and said that she didn't want to hear my explanation.  I repeated my
apology and offer, but it was refused again.

It's certainly true that I do get impatient at times (I'm not sure about
*a lot*).  But in thinking back on how we've dealt with impatience in the past, I realized
she regularly uses this method of shutting down the conversation when she's
upset about something I've said.  This has happened when she's been impatient
with me for not understanding her explanations or directions.  She'll
say things like, "Listen to my *words*!" and "I'm not going to repeat
myself, you just don't understand."  So the conversation gets shut down
in the same way it did this morning.  In other words, the same shutdown
happens whether it's me being impatient or her.

I don't think this is the way couples would normally settle disagreements
or fights.  I would expect there to be some accommodation for mistakes,
an acceptance of an apology, and a continuance of the discussion.  I could accept
hearing something like, "This is too exhausting for me; let's talk about
it later".  I sometimes do hear this when I'm trying to explain
something and *don't* express impatience, but it didn't happen this time,
probably because I offended her with my impatienece.
This means I need to be super-careful with what I say, and to be patient
as a saint at all times.  This may not be humanly possible, but it is a worthy goal
to keep in mind.

This incident demonstrates another example of what I think of as a double standard in
this relationship.  If I'm impatient, I need to apologize and offer to
make things right (the offer is frequently refused).  If she's impatient,
it's because I'm not listening.  Either way, I'm in the wrong.

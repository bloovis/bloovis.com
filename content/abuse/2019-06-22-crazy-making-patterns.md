There are several patterns in this relationship that are crazy-making --
and very confusing, because I haven't seen them in all my reading
about verbal abuse.  The most I can say to make sense of them is
that they seem to be about my partner's belief that I am merely
an extension of her will, and that when I fail to implement her
will perfectly, she becomes furious.  One such pattern revolves
around vacation planning.

I wrote earlier about the [book-throwing incident](/abuse/2019-05-31-book-throwing-incident/).
That incident started with her upset about my inability to engage about vacation
planning.  This pattern comes up frequently; it happened again a few days ago.
What typically happens is this:

She says something like, "We need to plan for our upcoming vacation time", but never
says anything like, "Can we sit down now and talk about plans?"  Then, after a few
days, she angrily accuses me of not engaging with her about plans.  In other words,
she seems to expect *me* to initiate the talks about plans, when *she* is the one
who expressed the need to talk.  What makes this even more crazy-making is that
when I say, "OK, let's sit down right now and do some planning", she refuses
the offer.  In fact, the offer seems to make her even more angry.

It's not that I mind the talking (though I find she needs *much* more
detail in these plans than I do; I tend to be more spontaneous and
don't need to know *exactly* when and where we have to be at every
step of the way).  What bothers me is having a responsibility pushed
on me that I did not ask for, and that was not *explicitly* pushed on
me in the first place.

I also have come to believe that her need for me to engage about planning
is mostly about her need for me to approve her ideas with enthusiasm,
and that my own ideas are much less important, and even dismissed.
When I tried to express my feelings about that last year, the result
was the book-throwing incident.  I have learned that I need to never
express such feelings.

Another example of a similar pattern is this: she frequently says
to me, "Help me remember something I need to do tomorrow".  This is
something I *never* ask her to do for me.  I feel it is my responsibility
to remember things that are important to me.  But she seems
to feel that it's natural for me to take on this role for her, again
as if I were a mere extension of her will.  Of course, when I fail
to remember something for her, she becomes very angry at me if she misses
or is late for an engagement.

A couple of days ago, I questioned her about her expectation of
my role as an reminder mechanism.  I mumbled something about how
it's difficult for me to remember things for her, when I have to
remember my own life necessities (plans, engagements, duties)
on a daily basis.  She expressed disbelief, saying something like,
"What all do you have to remember?!"  I felt terribly diminished
and devalued by this comment, because it seemed as if she was
saying my own life work is much less important than hers.  But
I have learned by now that I should never express any unhappiness
about things she has said to me, so I kept quiet.

Both of these patterns drive me crazy, and it's been difficult even to
be able to understand why they do.  It's not that I don't want to be helpful.
Yet in these examples, I seem to be stuck in a role where I am expected
to take on an implicit, unstated responsibility that I did not ask for,
and when I fail in this responsibility, I am subjected to yet another
angry blast.

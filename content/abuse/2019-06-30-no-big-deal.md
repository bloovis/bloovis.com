Frequently my wife tries to get reassurance from me that her abuse
of me is no big deal.  In other words, she wants me to agree
that constant criticism, throwing
my books on the floor, threatening to smash my piano, using f-bombs, yelling, and
all the rest of it, are just normal fights that married couples often have.

I'm pretty sure that she knows this isn't true, and that she wants me to back her
up in her denial.  Here are a few reasons why I think this is the case.

<!--more-->

1. She'll occasionally say things like, "C. and G. are having trouble
with their relationship, but we're a lot better off than they are!"
When I hear this, I want to say, "Did G. threaten to lock C. out of the house
and smash her looms?"  I'm sure the answer would be "no".

2. After the [book-throwing incident](/abuse/2019-05-31-book-throwing-incident/), she told me that
she had told some of her (female) friends about what had happened, and
that they unanimously agreed that her throwing my books on the floor
(on two successive days!) was no big deal, and that my asking for a
written agreement to stop the verbal abuse was crazy.  Here again, I'm
pretty sure that if these friends had been told that *I* was the one
who had threatened my wife and damaged her property, they would have
been horrified, and likely would have advised her to get a divorce or a
restraining order.

In both of these cases, it's pretty clear that she is trying to
get confirmation from me and her friends that her behavior is
not abusive.  But here are two more reasons why she knows that she *is* abusive,
and is *choosing* to be abusive:

1. She always treats me much better when there are other people
around.  This means she knows abuse is wrong and doesn't want
her friends to know she is abusive.

2. She gets terribly angry with me when she thinks I've told one of my
friends about what happened.  She'll say, "You should always talk to
me about our relationship first!  I *never* tell my friends any details
about our fights!"  I know this latter statement is false; see the
second case above.  If she didn't think she had done anything wrong,
she would not be afraid of me talking to others.

So now the question I have to answer is this: Why am I willing
to endure treatment that would likely get me a restraining order
or divorce papers if the tables were turned and I did those things
to my wife?

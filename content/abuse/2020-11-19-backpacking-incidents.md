It's been almost exactly a year since I wrote the last post here.  A
month and a half after I wrote that, I ran away from home and am now happily
living alone.  But recently I was thinking about a couple of tantrum
incidents that happened on two separate backpacking trips 
in the Emigrant Wilderness of the Sierra Nevada.

*Incident #1:*

The first incident happened in 2015.  We were camping at Lertora Lake,
and had the entire place to ourselves.  On the morning when we were
going to pack up and hike to the next lake, I couldn't find her
anywhere, and got a little worried.  I took a quick look at the tent,
and didn't see her (this turned out to be my big mistake).  So I
quickly walked up to the top of little granite knoll a couple of
hundred yards away, where I should have a view of the larger area
around the camp.  There was no sign of her, so I walked back to camp.
When I reached the tent, she rushed in from somewhere (perhaps the
lake shore) and started in with a long, angry rant about how she'd
been lookinng for me *everywhere*.  I told her I hadn't seen her and
had gotten worried, and she said she'd been napping in the tent the entire
time.  In her rant she told me how irresposible I'd been to leave camp
without telling her, how I'd not been looking very hard, etc.  Her
anger left me shaky for a long time, as was usually case when these
things happened (which was pretty frequently by this point in our
relationship).

*Incident #2:*

The next incident happened in 2019, rather late in the season.  It was
the first day of our trip, and we'd hiked a long way in, we were
tired, it was getting dark, and it was very cold and windy.  We
reached the side trail that led to nearby Toejam Lake, where I'd
camped a dozen years before.  The turnoff wasn't marked by a sign,
which didn't fit with my memory of the place, but I was very sure it
was the right trail.  She'd never been to this area before, but wasn't
convinced that I was right about the turnoff.  She said we should
continue along the main trail for 15 minutes to see if the turnoff was
actually ahead.  I knew this was a waste of time, and I checked the
map to make sure of our location.  But she insisted, and here is where
I made my big mistake.  I said something like: "Then we'll just have
to backtrack to this point again", with a note of resignation.  She
interpreted this as sarcasm and launched into one of her usual angry
rages.  She threw down her pack and departed down the main trail,
leaving me alone with both of our packs and not sure when she'd
return.  A half hour later she came back, still angry, and told me I
had a real mean streak, and that I hadn't apologized earlier.  This
wasn't true: I had apologized profusely before she threw down her pack
and stalked off, but she claimed she never heard the apologies.  (Yet
all through our marriage, I was supposedly the one who was a terrible
listener.)

Then she ordered me to hike down the side trail that I was sure led to Toejam
Lake, and said she'd follow 15 minutes behind me in case it was the
wrong trail.  But it was the correct trail.  I got to the lake, and
tried to find a sheltered place to camp out of the wind.  Eventually
she showed up, when it was getting even colder.  She never apologized
for her tantrum or doubting my knowledge of the area, apparently
believing that I was entirely at fault, as usual.  As before, this
incident left me feeling very shaky for the rest of the day.
